# PJ's GitHub Page... or, crispy-spork
A site that contains links to all of my *other* sites... because it's hard to like bookmark all of them, haha.

Recently, I updated this site so all of my expirements are relative links. This means they won't work in an iframe, I don't think, which is pretty shitty. I want to have it do like an automatic thing where if the domain is .github.io it's absolute and otherwise it's relative, but not yet :(

All of my old projects are still absolute links.
