# PJ's GitHub Page... or, crispy-spork
A site that contains links to all of my *other* sites... because it's hard to like bookmark all of them, haha.

Recently, I updated this site so all of my expirements are relative links so Netlify would work. This means they won't work in an iframe, I don't think, which is pretty shitty. All of my old projects are still absolute links.

What I'll probably end up doing is making it so all links are absolute links, and with Javascript automatically change necessary links (sidebar, expirements) based on if the domain is Netlify or not.
