<h1><span class="star">â˜…</span> Girl that got hit by a car in front of Billy's last night - m4w</h1>
<kbd>age: <b>27</b></kbd>
<p>I was outside smoking. You were crossing the street and got hit by a car. You bounced off the hood and landed on your feet yelling something about being indestructible.
<br><br>
The other night I almost got trapped in a dumpster because I was going after a pizza that I thought I wanted to take home with me. I've also recently slept on my kitchen floor.
<br><br>
I think we'd be a good fit for each other. Move in with me? Let's get married?
