Hardly are those words out   /When a vast image out of <i>Spiritus Mundi</i>/Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert   /A shape with lion body and the head of a man,   /A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,   /Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it   /Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.   /The darkness drops again; but now I know   /That twenty centuries of stony sleep/Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,   /And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,   /Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?",

Fell on my shoulders, song quieter than whatever I was pumping into my ears at the time—I'm glad it's lighter, but one of us is heavier for it. The bikes in the pathway don't make it better. I am ready to sit under the dogwood with you, but we have places to be. Spring came and I was too busy wishing for the end of winter to notice. Maybe I'll appreciate it tomorrow.",

Sentir que la he perdido./Oir la noche immensa, más inmensa sin ella./Y el verso cae al alma como al pasto el rocío./Qué importa que mi amor no pudiera guardarla./La noche está estrellada y ella no está conmigo./Eso es todo. A lo lejos alguien canta. A lo lejos./Mi alma no se contenta con haberla perdido./Como para acercarla mi mirada la busca./Mi corazón la busca, y ella no está conmigo./La misma noche que hace blanquear los mismos arboles./Nosotros, los de entonces, ya no somos los mismos./Ya no la quiero, es cierto pero cuánto la quise./Mi voz buscaba el viento para tocar su oído./De otro. Será de otro. Como antes de mis besos./Su voz, su cuerpo claro. Sus ojos infinitos./Ya no la quiero, es cierto, pero tal vez la quiero./Es tan corto al amor, y es tan largo el olvido./Porque en noches como ésta la tuve entre mis brazos,/mi alma no se contenta con haberla perdido./Aunque ésta sea el último dolor que ella me causa,/y éstos sean los últimos versos que yo le escribo./",
