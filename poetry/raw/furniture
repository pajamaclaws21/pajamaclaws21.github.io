Pornography

They shot him by the side of the road. The sun was tangled in
his hair as he leaned against the car. He fingered his chest, just
over his heart, as if touching it directly. —<em>My car broke down.
—You need oil and a belt. Take off your shirt.</em> You could consider
him compromised. There is no universe where he is not a
hitchhiker asking a rancher for help, where he is not plugged in
like a lamp. The doctor has to crack the ribs to get to the lungs.
The plumber has to pull out the sink to get to the pipes in the
walls. The pornographer has to adjust the bodies to catch the
slant of the light. He moves them like furniture. In the barn,
the rancher spreads a blanket and their clothes fall off consider-
ably. They are technicians. It is a compliment. They clock and
clam like eels and the night goes mink. I want to be them. I want
to be like them. I want to fuck everything but I don't want to be
touched. It's awful, my watching: the refusal to participate, the
ogling and smug superiority, the approximation of a true desire.
It's fake, but it isn't. It's art, but it isn't. They're pretending but
it doesn't matter because they're actually doing it, exhausting
themselves as the acting evaporates, peak peauty, that
moment—the swan dive, the little death, a bird flying into a
kitchen window, open or shut, this or nothing, it strips the
bolts. The camerman is standing very quietly. It looks like he
is weeping.
