My Alien Friend
--
The aliens took me & they
thought I was very strange.
The fact I ate without shame
(A private ritual for them. How was
I supposed to know?) entertained
them endlessly. My clothes
looked odd to the aliens (no
one on their planet covers up)
so I stripped to fit in and
they laughed and laughed
and laughed. I always wanted
to be a comedian. It didn't
take long to finish studying
me—not much to take note of—
so they brought me back to
Earth and gave me a lollypop
and my independence and
sent me on my way. It's
been a year now since my
abduction, but my clothes
still itch and my hunger still
feels like an embarrassment.
I miss that UFO. I think
I'd like to go back.
