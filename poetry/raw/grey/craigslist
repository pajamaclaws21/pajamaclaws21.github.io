Girl that got hit by a car in front of Billy's last night - m4w

I was outside smoking. You were crossing the street and got hit by a car. You bounced off the hood and landed on your feet yelling something about being indestructible.

The other night I almost got trapped in a dumpster because I was going after a pizza that I thought I wanted to take home with me. I've also recently slept on my kitchen floor.

I think we'd be a good fit for each other. Move in with me? Let's get married?
