For Grace, after a party

<id1>You do not always know what I am feeling.</id1>
Last night in the warm spring air while I was
blazing my tirade against someone who doesn't interest
<id2>me, it was love for you that set me</id2>
afire,
<id2>and isn't it odd? for in rooms full of</id2>
strangers my most tender feelings
<id4>writhe and</id4>
bear the fruit of screaming. Put out your hand,
isn't there
<id2>an ashtray, suddenly, there? beside</id3>
the bed? And someone you love enters the room
and says wouldn't
<id3>you like the eggs a little different today?</id3>
<id4>And when they arrive they are</id4>
just plain scrambled eggs and the warm weather
is holding.
