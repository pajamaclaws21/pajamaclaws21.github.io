My Cowboy Friend

Writing pretty had gotten the better of me and there's too much denim and exhaustion around here to do anything with except maybe soak it all in gasoline and wonder why the spit on the back of your tongue tastes sweet and read the stanzas a baker's dozen of times to blend the words into a soup full of muffins and beds and sunlight a hose that doesn't make a ton of sense but is long and green and gets away from you like the snake that comes through at night and wiggles in my ears until there's hands shoving a shoulder into a carpter and a Oh You're Back proceeding a few hours or rug burn and quiet boy breath on faces and the weird silence that comes from having done nothing at all directly in someone else's presence for days at this point and my mouth is too sweet for someone who hasn't eaten all day your not exactly sugar more like protein and chocolate chips and a country song that I didn't know you actually listened to the seven hundred times it's come up on shuffle and a saint with too much electricity and maybe summer isn't summer without yâ€”
or maybe the stars are mixing with the thread in my pocket and the cloth that is you and the denim and the states are getting scrambled across the bedcovers and this sugar is begging to taste too much like the condensation on a shot glass or a love bite or swapped lenses or the something better because okay isn't a definitive word when it's more soil and potential and someone else's guitar up there but a guy could live off protein and heavy salt and chocolate with minimal difficulties
