Lluvia pasada
--
Alfonsina Storni (tr. me)
--
For seven long days the rain
Beat monotonous on my window.
Seven long days.
My heart, flooded with water.

In my lips, clouds,
in my chest, shadows,
in my hands, books; cheeks white.
Seven long days...
wet sidewalks, black umbrellas.

Today, in my face,
four purple roses are born.
In all of the cages,
the heaven-gold put nightingales.

Blood gurgles, feet wobble,
the flesh tightens and the soul spills out;
drowning fluid surrounds my body,
pores open. I cannot hold back my soul.

Oh, pity, pity!
So much spring that fails to achieve the cup
  <id1>To be drunk.</id1>
So much spring that does not achieve the flame
  <id1>To be burned.</id1>

You, where do you hide, you, who still haven't
the cloths, nets, sieves, meshes
that they would entangle my flowers-blue
to be defeated by love? By sweet words?

Where are the hands of iron, of silk
that would take me from this morning
sunlit, never letting go; the hands
that would make me red, being white?

Oh, my spring, who achieved its flame!
Oh, my spring, in its violent hands
lost and fancied!

This translation has some lines translated in a way I like and some lines from Orlando Ricardo Menes's translation. Overall, I thought some of his English word choices were weird. I'm not aiming for this to be a direct translation, but more of a meaning-based one. Like I mentioned in the <a href="/poetry/poem.html?poem=lluvia">other commentary</a>, one source I found for this poem has an additional stanza. A rough translation is <i>"Bird wings recieve my kisses, / Meadow flowers recieve their wings; / The birds, searching, searching, / for the paths less traveled."</i>
