It's spring and I'm in love with you

Spring came on my walk to the bus: I think I'm allowed to be ignorant. Fell on my shoulders, song quieter than whatever I was pumping into my ears at the timeâ€”I'm glad it's lighter, but one of us is heavier for it. The bikes in the pathway don't make it better. I am ready to sit under the dogwood with you, but we have places to be. Spring came and I was too busy wishing for the end of winter to notice. Maybe I'll appreciate it tomorrow.
