My Cowboy Friend

The floorboards have a tendency to speak freely, dusty piano keys. They communicate through the small creaks, like gaped teeth, cracked calcium in my mouth that won’t form the proper vowels. And suddenly I’m five again and I can’t get my R's out, or anything for that matter. And everyone is wondering what’s going on with the boy with the porcelain teeth and glass tongue who might shatter like a glass in an opera when the rawness goes up and the quiet goes down. 
I know they can feel it, there’s not much to say (and that’s a fluid lie in prose form which we both know because the air is so thick with the unsaid things that taste like clove and worse) and it’s not uncomfortability to quote because that’s dead but something closer to a damn holding back a river in which there’s a shipwreck all inside in a stomach on a kitchen counter. 
You can’t just drown people. 
To be a floorboard, speaking without a voice, exploding with so much sound, an outlet right there, to cry when stepped on. It’s a bottle of feathers on my shelf who will scatter if freed I fear, soft spots in rib bones, rot in the middle of a floor. I saw a boy on a balcony with a crown made of spoons. He was feeding pigeons pieces of his sleep schedule. He looked happy.
My mouth has too many latches, not enough doors. These words are threatening to crack my ribs and safeguards. I’m pretty sure I’m made of salt and suggestion; find a loose string behind my ear and brace for the Niagara Falls of what’s to come. Don’t look too hard (that’s a plea not an order I don’t have control left)
Only my thumbs and pen can ramble.
