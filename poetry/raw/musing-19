Musing (July 19)

It's been too long since I sat down and typed. I attribute this to my comfortability at hand, now, maybe I am more meticulous. I worry whenever anyone gets too close—here is another thing for you to mess up. I once said that I feel like a net. Rather, a fine-tooth comb. The worst part of having lice, of being infested, is the clean-up. Not the knowledge. I don't know if knowledge hurts but it doesn't me. Doubt me. Then I lose momentum & track of what to say. Something Parisian. My morning's breakfast pain sans chocolat, somehow after all these stretches my brain comes back to the ocean swells, sailors, and peaches. Something nostalgic. Something homely—— <span class="strikethrough">a realization</span>; not really; <span class="strikethrough">I recoil</span> <span class="strikethrough">I turn around</span> "girar"
