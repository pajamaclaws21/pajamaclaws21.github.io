On Hedonism

Anne Carson

Beauty makes me hopeless. I donâ€™t care why
anymore I just want to get away. When I look
at the city of Paris I long to wrap my legs
around it. When I watch you dancing there is a
heartless immensity like a sailor in a dead-calm
sea. Desires as round as peaches bloom in me
all night, I no longer gather what falls.

Anne Carson's book, "Plainwater," is absolutely WONDERFUL, and has so so so much good poetry. Her piece "Mimnermos: The Brainsex Paintings," with its imagined interview between her and Greek philosopher Mimnermos, is so well done.
