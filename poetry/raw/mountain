My Cowboy Friend

you’re a hell of a heartbreaker
god stitched you out of shadow and wildfire/then left you alone so you could grow/in your own danger way/so the rest of us could learn/what want *really* feels like.

they say you eat men.
leave boots by ravines/bone dust in the sun/firelight stories/teeth
Those shadows jumping
everyone else shifts, your rock salt and granite don’t know how
you got names older than language, bones deeper then life
some say a ghost lives up there/some say god/i say it’s just you,
and that’s enough to scare a man straight
or love him crooked.

and i still come back
(call that devotion or plain dumb love)
same thing
Biblically it is anyway.
You're my church, chapel of shattered glass
(Praying only for storms because)
i saw your face in the lightning once, crept up when I was looking at the road
laughed so hard my brother yelled/the rain was lashing, filling the truck bed and my eyes
because even the sky tries to kiss you.
