Five things that made me think

<li>I closed my eyes for a second trying to orient myself. I think it's enough, but I'm not really sure. I won't really know until I've finished, until my parents are calling from the other room that it's time to draw straws, if anything can ever get done.</li>
<li>I've tried to fix this 3 times now. This is the third. I don't know if I ever will be able to. One of my favorite poems mentions the drowning fluid; a soul that cannot ever fly; sloughing skin and freeing oneself from their wings. One of my favorite people once compared me to a pigeon, but I think I pick up too much to not be a raven. I tend to the birds as my friends, or rather I would like to. I tend to my friends as birds, or rather I try to.</li>
<li>One of the prettiest facets of porcelain is its cracks. The little marks that show up in a still-resting vase. One of the sweetest tastes is clove. It cloys the way your heart does under pressure. It hurts the way your stomach moves when you try and respond.</li>
<li>In my pocket, I carry the trinkets I don't want to lose. A piece of string. A lost feather. A sewing needle. The jacket you see him wear is stitched himself, or it appears to be. He lost too many spoons on the road, so he carries them on his head. There is no stranger, here. No thing nor mare.</li>
<li>In the house, yellow light beams through a window. It is something I find comforting. That's why I've written it so many times. That's why I come back to it, so many times. The warm dots of green that show up on her walls when you sleep. Glasses shaking you awake. A spoon falls from the crown, and he bends to pick it up. When you blink, you're behind a glass door.</li>
