Essay on the Bathroom Floor

I turn the shower on. Watch myself undress. Mirrors are my shiniest wounds. Fog blooms on the glass---the water must be hot, the water must feel good, the water would make me better. In another life, I allow myself warmth without punishment. This is not that life. I lie down on the cold tile. My skin hisses, scrambles, tries to escape. I stay put. I recite French verb conjugations & <i>America's Next Top Model</i> winners & people who don't love me anymore. When I rise, the mirror is thick with steam. No reflection. The water is tepid when it touches me. I sway under the showerhead.
