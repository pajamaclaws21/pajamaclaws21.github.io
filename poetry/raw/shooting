<li>this is not a poem,<br>this is is an obituary/written in present tense/we’ll end in my own epitaph if i can manage</li>
<li>this building is filled with so much death already Im choking on it/am i still alive?<br><br>Casualty walking</li>
<li>he’s in the math wing with his fathers gun/ending generations with a happy trigger finger<br>i can hear him/can you?</li>
<li>can you?<br>How many bloody lamentations have been poured for your sacred flag?</li>
<li>this is the last thing i will write<br>before he opens that door<br>with a barrel/can you see this? Do you watch?</li>
<li>he’s a victim as am I/this is your flood and you left your young without an ark/you’re a god that forgot what mercy means</li>
<li>What passing bells for those who die as cattle/for each child with broken arteries at a desk/we get no holiness behind the repeat and stutter from down the hall</li>
<li>can you hear them crying?</li>
<li>Does God watch from the heavens? The eternal witness to our murder/the creator and chronicler of our death/we bleed your red/does that mean you see us?<br><br>we can’t even go to fifth period<br>without mapping exit wounds.</li>
<li>pray/not that it’ll do much/you don’t seem to care</li>
<li>are you proud of your silence?</li>
<li>they worship your second amendment (commandment?)<br>like it was written in fire<br><br>holy and sacred are getting awful close to the idea of an open casket</li>
<li>(30 seconds left. Maybe/time has a tendency to stutter when your waiting to be unmade)</li>
<li>Signed, your student(which people are beginning to pronounce more like Collateral) (momentarily at least)<br>a name you’ll pronounce wrong<br>at the service you won’t attend</li>
<li>hold a candle to speed me/say a holy goodbye/weep not just for me/ring bells for my legacy that will never dawn<br>im out of time/which is to say/this is definitely your fault</li>
