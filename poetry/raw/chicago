When the War Comes to Chicago

I'd like to think that, even as a zombie, I'd
remember the route to your house. Can I
come over in the flesh-peeling aftermath
of the second sun? (I heard you can see
their shadows at the Art Institute. I heard
you can see their ghosts walking among
us.) We can drink a cup of water together
& die in the city's nouveau confused
weather, ashy raindrops and a July snow.
(I heard it only took 3 minutes to get here.
Took me 30 to come over.)

<li>I didn't do it 'cause I was scared,<br>I just wanted to come home.</li>
<li>My whole family's out, anyways.</li>
<li>Could I maybe stay over?</li>
