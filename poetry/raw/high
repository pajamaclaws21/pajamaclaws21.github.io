"I like that you always look a little high..."

I like that you always look a little high, even though you never are. You use big words and over explain, as if being misunderstood is the worst thing you could possibly be. When you run your hands through your hair, it stays exactly where you left it, curling up toward the sky or maybe sometimes even tucked behind your ear. You sat in my passenger seat and read the directions off to me even though they were right there on my screen. I wondered how the fuck I'm the only person that feels this way towards you. I want you shirtless in the sunshine, contemplative, by my side in silence. I imagine you standing, hunched over a bowl of cereal carefully cradled in your hands, and can't think of anything I crave more. It would be a joke if I'm meant to wade through this feeling all alone.
