(just let it happen)

lover i know the weight you bear
lover i know the spear head you suffer on
lover i know how the world digs into your shoulders and i know in the way Penelope knew
you’ve come to the edge
There is something polite about a bluff isn’t there?
No yawn (chasm)
no blood (gash)/ the press of holy and almost/a drop/a fall/the earth left unoffended/though god knows,
there are vampires in the valley,
and teeth in the wind(don’t shake love, no cruelty is housed here)
i know the policy of the jump lover, the consent it doesn’t ask for/nor it refuse
It does not scream/It does not beg
to beg would be crass.
So it waits/breathes as you choke
Softens itself into chalk and stillness.
(go to it)
go with respect
go with clean hands and a bowed head
go with damp curls and a soft voice, the certainty of Solomon in your footsteps
the salt of Job pressed to your tongue/think of me love when you see the shape of the earth/the lack thereof/in the hush it holds/i hold
(like ritual/who said worship needed to be spoken/who said worship went beyond the trust)
i warn: there’s no kindness housed here/beyond the initial/no softness after the first/no slipping. we operate in yes and nos darling/the fall doesn’t embrace a maybe, worship is done in certainty/no more (no less)
There is etiquette here/the bluff insists upon it
so don’t call/flinch/just give
your consent to the fall/to me/to Him
your breath left behind
