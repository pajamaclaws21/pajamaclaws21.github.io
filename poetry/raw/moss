(Moss covers the stage---so much that it ceases to be a stage, it is only moss, sprawling, going well past what used to be the stage, covering everything. Covering the griefs. Covering the goodnesses. Covering all of it. A person enters.)

PERSON: Oh! Moss!

(They kneel down.)

PERSON: (patting the moss) Pat pat pat.

END OF PLAY.

Some Googling revealed that Dalton Day posted this poem on their Tumblr account. That seems to be the first place it came from, but I'm not 100% sure. If you know, hmu.
