Rural Boys Watch the Apocalypse

We stand together in the creek in my backyard
watchin' the stars fall one at a time.
A third of the sky's black now.
Your hand's in mine.

"I thought it'd be... wilder than this," you say.
"Four horsemen, trumpets & earthquakes,
waters turnin' to blood, ya know?"

But there are only the fallin' stars.

"'Least the weather channel warned us about it," I say.
"Glad they predicted somethin' right for once."

My doomsday neighbors are loadin' the back
of their dirty ol' pick-up--- suitcases stacked
under cardboard boxes of books & silverware
stacked under large whitewashed crosses.

My parents didn't pack up
& neither did yours.

"If there are angels walkin' the streets,
I wanna see 'em," your ma told us over coffee.
"I wanna know if they really got
lion-teeth & a hundred thousand eyes.
