I wrote a good omelet... and ate a hot poem...
after loving you

Buttoned my car... and drove my coat home... in the rain...
after loving you

I goed on red... and stopped on green... floating somewhere in between...
being here and being there...
after loving you

I rolled my bed... and turned down my hair... slightly confused but... I don't care...
Laid out my teeth... and gargled my gown... then I stood... and laid me down...
to sleep...
after loving you
