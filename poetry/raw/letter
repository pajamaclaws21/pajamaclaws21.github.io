Prose To Them (sister wife gratification)

it stands to reason,
if each our bodies are carved from generations of those who have loved
(and been loved in turn)
that we fit somewhere 
in Gods puzzle (chaos) of a world/physicality sliding in with genetics/who do our souls belong too?

locks?
you two were born (separate
 i know blood runs thick but ice is better and in this freezing place all we have is ice between us/Not making sense/you’ll read this with understanding anyway/watch the parenthesis)
with the keys in your mouth//
i know my skin matches my mother’s
but the way i write/that’s you.
the way i explode (grin-first)/you too.
my walk and callouses and words/you two
i can’t tell where you end /or where i realized the slide of our natures stands to reason because at the end of the road we know that I have always carried pieces
of you both in my back pocket
next to the rings and half truths and hall passes 

The point:
my laugh belongs to my cousin
my anger, to my brother/the men who taught me How to swing but it’s you who told me When
my heart? that’s your fault.
most of it
the beat/the break/the rebuild:
 broken glass has never
looked so much like a mosaic
(until you both held the shards and added your own peices/called it constellation)
/i am an ensemble of things halflost:
coffee stains, bad metaphors,
prayer beads and whatever the hell these things are:/
and you, sweet architects/stitched me back together. with hoodie strings

what i’m saying is:
(in lowercase, because it’s truer)
you are nothing I’m sure of/youth die fast 
but since knowing you i know
the way my name sounds when it’s not a threat
& if the sky falls
(which it will)
we’ll build a new one because
i was born holding
two corners of the same cosmos—
(my left hand soft from you / and the right,
too full of laughter
not to be yours)
