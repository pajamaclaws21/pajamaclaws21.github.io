						Studygiggle has come a long way. But it's still quite a long way from where I want it to be.
						<br><br>
						I have run into oh my gosh so many issues with Google, at this point, I feel like I need to
						completely start over? I want to design CSS that looks cool for the site. I want all the
						functionality to be down pat before it's ready for sending out to the world.
						<br><br>
						But unfortunately all of the functionality isn't down pat! While a bit of the Snap! Cloud
						code is done (thanks to work with Michael and reading so much code my eyes burn) it for the 
						most part isn't. And Google code needs to be completely scrapped; I'm entering uncharted
						territory.
						<br><br>
						So. It's gonna be a while before Studygiggle releases. Sorry if y'all were on the edge of your
						seats.
