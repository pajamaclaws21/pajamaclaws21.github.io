Migration Pt. 2 (2/21/25)
--
Based on a comment I made on <a href="https://github.com/pajamaclaws21/pajamaclaws21.github.io/commit/38eaa190724ef9bc85e6c89324b0ff15036880ae">GitHub</a>. Today, I've made commits that are effectively my final shift to using pajamaclaws21.onrender.com rather than pajamaclaws21.github.io! My poetry page on my phone stopped working a few days ago and I couldn't figure out why for the life of me. The poem.html page would load fine, but it wouldn't load the raw poem text!! This was so so so aggravating, and there were no errors in the browser console to be seen... until today I figured out why the poems wouldn't load. The PWA I had installed on my phone was for my GitHub page and my poetry raw files were trying to be loaded from my Render page... so I fixed that all by deleting my GitHub PJ21 PWA and installing a Render PJ21 PWA... but then the images & app icon wouldn't load! Because I had forgotten to update my manifest! So I had to make yet another commit to fix that!! But now it is all fixed, and all finally migrated. Thank godddd...
