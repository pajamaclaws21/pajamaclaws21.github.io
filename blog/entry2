Website Thoughts (8/28/24)
--
Life update; school's back in session! I have less time and more energy to devote to Studygiggle, which means 0 work will get done. In the meantime, there's a ton of stuff I want for this website. I'm taking a CS course, and that means that I have lots of time to work on this site! While it's a shame I can't really fit all that I want onto this entry and I can't really put it into words, I will certainly try. Today, I added a programatic dropdown thing so I can add classes that will be treated as dropdowns to <a href="/src/dropdowns.js">dropdowns.js</a>, added a <a href="/blank.html">blank page</a>, wrote a new blog post, and figured out how to turn on word wrap. Now: the things I want!

<b>Thing 1: Automatic Relative Links</b>
Recently, I updated this site so all of my expirements are relative links so Netlify would work. This makes my site infinitely harder to navigate in an iframe. (All of my old projects are still absolute links, and they will remain so.) I want my site to automatically change the domain of applicable links to be a relevant absolute link. That means, if you're viewing the GitHub hosted one, you'll get sent to a GitHub page, but if you're viewing the Netlify hosted one, you'll get sent to a Netlify page.

<b>Thing 2: Neater Dropdown Stuff</b>
There's so much nested, ugly code, and you can only go down 1 level right now. Not a top-priority fix. <br> Oh Jesus, just thinking of this a few seconds after I committed the post, but I really badly want the site to automatically switch between like side arrows and down arrows like real cool dropdowns. That probably requires Javascript to change the CSS of each class when clicked... maybe I could do that programatically with like, add CSS for each class' opened and closed... hmm...

<b>Thing 3: Automatic Blog Stuff</b>
Making it so the sidebar automatically populates with the entries I write. Maybe each entry is its own file and the blog page just displays it?
