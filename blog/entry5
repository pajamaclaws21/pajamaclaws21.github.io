WBIB v3 (01/10/25)
--
First entry of the new year! And a short one. Today to my site was added <a href="/experiments/wbib3.html">WBIB v3</a>!! It's the third edition in a pretty long line of how-can-I-get-things-to-load-my-computer's-owner-doesn't-let-it-load. W***media images (you can guess what I'm trying to say) are EXTREMELY useful, and have lots of cool things, too! Unfortunately, the owners can't just block the explicit stuff, they have to block it all. So. Innovation!<br><br>
WBIB v3 is specifically built around reading Wikipedia pages, and therefore has some stuff built in that Wikipedia loads specifically. For example, "//" in relative links in websites are auto-replaced with "https://", "/" before a relative link is replaced with "https://currently-loaded-site.com/relative-link" (more on this later), clicking links opens them in WBIB, srcs in images are replaced with an AllOrigins API URL accessing them, and most importantly (and distinctively from WBIB v2): this version loads the website's content directly on the page, rather than in an iframe. I need to do this so that I can modify the page's content. WHAT THIS MEANS IS!! if you load an image, or any file other than plain text, WBIB v3 will fail to load it. This is a stark, stark divergence from WBIB v2, which I recommended some folks use to display W***media images in person.<br><br>
I also took away Textise support, because... quite frankly, I never used it, and the owner of my computer turned it off on my device A While Ago. As much as I liked it and it was good for security... it can't stay. Alas :(<br><br>
My next thing to implement in WBIB v3 is checking if the website URL ends in .png, .jpg, .webp, et cetera, and if so displaying the desired image (via an accessor AllOrigins API URL) instead. But that is not written yet. It should be coming soon. I also need to add a feature to re-load all the images on a given page, because sometimes, not all of them load immediately. Which: bad!<br><br>
Okay, remember where I said "more on this later"? Well, here it is. Because all relative links are replaced with absolute links, CSS stylesheets can finally be loaded from the majority of websites!!! Yay!!! It's very awesome, and it means that sites look so so so much better.<br><br>
This has been a project of only today and yesterday(? I don't really remember) so I hope I can improve on it in the future. Anyways, the main message of this blog post is: WBIB v3 is OUT and awesome for Wikipedia pages, but don't use it on much else yet, because it doesn't function the same as WBIB2. I'll keep y'all posted :)
