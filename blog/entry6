Migration (01/16/25)
--
Small update to let folks know that the <a href="https://pajamaclaws21.onrender.com">Render</a> hosting of my website is now the "official" one, with .github.io and .netlify.app being mirrors. I don't use either of them very much anymore, so I'm going to put less effort into maintaining them.

<b>What happened?</b> I don't know! Went to my website today and discovered that the owners of my computer have now blocked loading any resources from Github, which broke most of the CSS and JS of my website for a few hours. I changed pretty well all of the links to now direct to and load from my Render page, so hopefully it'll be all fixed. At least it didn't break autoblogging... that much... just a link change, like all of my other pages. Now I guess I'm gonna have to update my Google Search Console about it, but whatever. This is frustrating to me!! I wish it weren't this way!!!!! Raghhhhhhhhhhh!! I think, at this point, if much more happens-- I might as well switch to the unlimited free Cloudflare hosting? I read that's pretty good, and offers a decent amount of storage. We'll see. Might have to decomission some of these old pages soon. (I'm still fucking mad about this)
