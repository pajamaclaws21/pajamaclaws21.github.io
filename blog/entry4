On Poetry (11/15/24)
--
And today was sort of a big day for the site in general! I added a whole bunch of stuff, mostly poetry, which you can find at <a href="/poetry">/poetry</a>. It features 10 of my favorite poems in the whole world, some of which with added commentary. There are a few poems in Spanish I want to add, but I'm still debating how to include the translations. Anyways, that's about it! Lots of work went into designing the poetry pages & making them functional.<br><br>
The poem "Rain" by Joy Harjo is on the poetry page but hasn't been added to the site yet, because I'm debating how to include it. I haven't been able to find the poem anywhere online outside of the physical anthology I have, so I sort of want to make it a permanent page, rather than the programatically-generated pages the site makes for the rest of the poems.<br><br>
This programatic process is very similar to my <a href="#entry3">autoblogging process</a>, but much simpler, because I only have to deal with one poem at a time, rather than a bunch of blog posts. The <a href="/poetry/poem.html">poem.html</a> page recieves a URL parameter which tells the page the file name of the poem to load. Then, it gets the raw text of the file, and splits it by the double-hyphens, ending up with an array in the form of [title, author, poem, commentary]. (The commentary section isn't in every poem yet.) The page then updates each element on the page to make it fit the data array, and voila! A poem :)<br><br>
Alrighty, that's all for now. See ya in a couple months!
