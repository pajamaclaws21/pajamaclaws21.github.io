Eventually lay servers or sacristans performed duties earlier associated with acolytes, and the order of acolyte was normally conferred upon a candidate for priesthood in the course of his training. The minor orders were not perpetuated in Anglicanism. Some of the duties earlier performed by persons in the minor order of acolyte were taken over by lay clerks.

The history of the Alabama Plan indicates that any congregation which conscientiously involves itself in the process can expect an increase in the number of its pledges and an increase in the amount of its pledged income as well as other less tangible but not less positive effects.

The options for the readings include the Witch of Endor (1 Sm 28:3-25), the Vision of Eliphaz the Temanite (Jb 4:12-21), the Valley of Dry Bones (Ez37;1-14), and the War in Heaven (Rv 12:[1-6]7-12). The readings are followed by a psalm, canticle, or hymn, and a prayer. The BOS notes that &#8220;suitable festivities and entertainments&#8221; may precede or follow the service, and there may be a visit to a cemetery or burial place.The popular name for this festival is Halloween. It was the eve of Samhain, a pagan Celtic celebration of the beginning of winter and the first day of the new year. This time of the ingathering of the harvest and the approach of winter apparently provided a reminder of human mortality. It was a time when the souls of the dead were said to return to their homes. Bonfires were set on hilltops to frighten away evil spirits. Samhain was a popular festival at the time when the British Isles were converted to Christianity.

He served St. John&apos;s Church, Lawrence, Massachusetts, before joining the inaugurating faculty of the Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1867. His thought and broad church stance were substantially shaped by his attention to such English broad church leaders as Frederick William Robertson, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Frederick Denison Maurice. His two major works, The Continuity of Christian Thought (1884) and Christian Institutions (1897), represent his broad and spacious incarnational theology and his probing methodology. He once said of himself, &#8220;I am always moving, as it seems to me, underground, beneath institutions and customs and formulas of thought, and trying to get at some deeper meaning.&#8221; He also wrote Life and Letters of Phillips Brooks, 2 vols.

He went to North China as a missionary in 1895 but was sent home in 1903 because of poor health. He served briefly as a parish priest until he resigned in protest over what he saw as a disregard for the meaning of baptism. Thereafter he devoted his life mainly to research, visiting overseas missions, and writing. His book Missionary Methods: St. Paul&apos;s or Ours?, appeared in 1912. He describes the apostle as visiting a selected city, imparting the gospel to converts and, perhaps only two years later, ordaining leaders so that the eucharist could always be celebrated. St. Paul would then depart, leaving behind a complete self-supporting and self-governing church under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. The Spontaneous Expansion of the Church and the Causes which Hinder It (1927) summarized much of his teaching, presenting careful arguments for a truly indigenous ordained ministry of clergy with many remaining in secular work. Allen retired with his family to Kenya during the early 1930s. The local bishop permitted him to celebrate, but felt it was too dangerous to allow him to preach.",

The people came to the altar rails to receive the sacrament, which meant that the altar rails served as communion rails. Some places continued the early church practice of administering communion by ministers who moved among the people. Standing was the normal posture for receiving communion until the thirteenth century, when kneeling to receive the sacrament became customary. This practice was related to the elevation of the host by the celebrant. Altar rails were first used in England during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. The Puritans disliked altar rails. They often removed them from churches and moved the altar into the body of the church. William Laud (1573-1645), Archbishop of Canterbury, directed that altars be returned to the east wall of churches and fenced by altar rails for protection against desecration. The altar rails were latticed. Bishop Wren of Norwich noted that they were &#8220;so thick with pillars that doggs may not gett in.&#8221; The English clergy continued to move among the people to administer the sacraments until the eighteenth century, when the altar rail came to be used as the communion rail. In the nineteenth century, the chancel was seen as the room for the sacrament and the nave was seen as the room for the liturgy of the word. Altar rails in the Episcopal Church are low, reflecting the assumption that the people will kneel to receive communion. Altar rails may be made of metal or wood. Current liturgical usage has emphasized the shared participation of celebrant and people in the eucharist, and tended to remove barriers between the altar and the congregation. Standing to receive the sacrament is practiced with increasing frequency, and altar rails have been removed from some churches. Altar rails may become obsolete as standing to receive communion becomes more widespread in the Episcopal Church.",

Although he was brought up in a Christian family, he had not been baptized when he became involved in the election of a Bishop of Milan. Ambrose served as mediator between the battling factions of Arians and orthodox Christians. The election was important because the victorious party would control the powerful See of Milan. While he was exhorting the nearly riotous mob to keep the peace and to obey the law, the crowd called out, &#8220;Ambrose shall be our bishop!&#8221; He protested, but the people persisted. Ambrose was baptized with haste, and subsequently ordained bishop on Dec. 7, 374. He rose rapidly to defend the orthodoxy of the church against Arianism. He introduced antiphonal chanting to enrich the liturgy. He wrote straightforward, practical discourses to educate his people in such matters of doctrine as baptism, the Trinity, the eucharist, and the Person of Christ. His persuasive preaching was an important factor in the conversion of Augustine of Hippo. Ambrose baptized Augustine in 387. Ambrose did not fear to rebuke emperors, including Theodosius, whom he forced to do public penance for the slaughter of several thousand citizens of Thessalonica. Among hymns in The Hymnal 1982 attributed to Ambrose are &#8220;The eternal gifts of Christ the King&#8221; (233-234), &#8220;O Splendor of God&apos;s glory bright&#8221; (5), &#8220;O God, creation&apos;s secret force&#8221; (14-15), &#8220;Now Holy Spirit&#8221; (19-20), &#8220;O God of truth, O Lord of Might&#8221; (21-22), and &#8220;Redeemer of the nations come&#8221; (55).

Anglicanism reflects the balance and compromise of the via media of the Elizabethan settlement between Protestant and Catholic principles. Anglicanism also reflects balance in its devotion to scripture, tradition, and reason as sources of authority. The via media of Anglicanism is expressed frequently in terms of a &#8220;golden mean&#8221; between extreme positions on either side of various issues. Anglicanism is both traditional and dynamic in the discovery of new expressions. It retains the ancient authorities of scripture and tradition. It also allows for development of new understandings of Christian faith and practice in continuity with the historical church. Until the present century, Anglicanism was largely defined in terms of its English origins and preservation of the language and customs of English-speaking peoples. For example, the Episcopal Church and the various Anglican churches in the British colonies retained their English heritage through a common language, Prayer Book worship, and an episcopal polity. At the end of the nineteenth century, however, Anglicanism began to take on a new identity. The national churches which derived from the Church of England became more conscious of their own identity while remaining in communion with the See of Canterbury. They also retained a common Anglican theological and ecclesial identity. Anglicanism is now a worldwide family of churches which share a common theological heritage and polity.

It has placed considerable emphasis upon the sacramental life of the church, especially the central importance of the Holy Eucharist, and the Apostolic succession of the episcopate. Anglo-catholics were concerned not only with doctrine but with restoring the liturgical and devotional expression of doctrine in the life of the Anglican Church. Some of these expressions, such as the use of eucharistic vestments, altar candles, and incense, led to the controversy over ritual in the later part of the nineteenth century in the Episcopal Church. From the 1860s onward, the movement advanced steadily in America, especially in urban areas and in the Midwest. Anglo-catholic leaders included James DeKoven, Ferdinand Ewer, Charles Grafton, and John Henry Hopkins, Jr. In the earlier part of the twentieth century, Anglo-catholicism was especially strong in Britain and the United States, and in some Anglican churches in Africa.<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\tAnglo-catholics sponsored Congresses which produced serious theological essays on the pastoral ministry of the church and on social questions. In the United States and Britain, Anglo-catholics were frequently involved in ministry to the poor of the large cities. They were also active in ecumenical conversations with the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches. The liturgical and theological scholarship of Anglo-catholics had considerable influence upon the revisions of the BCP in the United States in 1928 and 1976, including the central importance attached to the eucharist.</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\tControversies within Anglicanism in recent decades over the meaning of doctrinal tradition, the ordination of women, ecumenical conversations with Protestant churches, and liturgical renewal have led to divisions among Anglo-catholics. Some have seen themselves as a party within the church who are called to defend what they believe to be the traditions of Anglicanism. Others have supported theological and liturgical developments because they believe these changes are consistent with the catholic heritage of Anglicanism.</div>\n",

Two of his most celebrated books are Monologium and Proslogium, in which he articulated a rational, ontological proof for the existence of God. His argument is that &#8220;God is that than which nothing greater can be conceived.&#8221; In Cur deus homo Anselm presented his understanding of the Atonement. He argued that the God-man, Jesus Christ, who was sinless, died for sinful humanity and made satisfaction for humanity&apos;s debt to God.

The word &#8220;antinomian&#8221; seems to have emerged in the sixteenth century when it was applied to the teaching of the Lutheran theologian, J. Agricola, as well as that of certain Anabaptist sects. Although the word antinomian was not used in earlier times, St. Paul himself was accused of setting aside the force of the Law because of his teaching about justification. Lutheranism is thought by some to have invited antinomianism because of its emphasis on justification by faith alone. Anglican opposition to antinomianism is indicated in Article XII of the Articles of Religion: &#8220;Good works . . . cannot put away our sins; . . . yet they are pleasing and acceptable to God in Christ&#8221; (BCP, p. 870).",

The doctrine in Greek theology is extremely complex and the source of much controversy. Basically, however, it is the assertion that human beings, because of their finitude and sinfulness, cannot comprehend God&#039;s essence or being. God &quot;lies beyond&quot; or transcends all human apprehension of God, except as God is revealed in the positive symbols of revelation and the knowledge of God which is possible through the positive categories of dogma (cataphatic theology). Ultimately, God is &quot;unknowable,&quot; not as an absence of knowledge but as a knowledge of silence or negativity-the kind of knowledge which is possible in the silence of contemplation.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\tWestern or Latin theology has generally been more positive (scientific) in its approach to human knowledge of God, but the apophatic is found in both the theological and the mystical tradition. Thomas Aquinas, for example, begins his Treatise on God with the statement, &quot;Now we cannot know what God is, but only what God is not; we must therefore consider the ways in which God does not exist, rather than the ways in which God does.&quot; He then proceeds to discuss how God is known from the positive effects of God in creation. This tradition is also carried out in the mystical tradition of Meister Eckhart, John of the Cross, and many others. One of its chief contemporary exponents is Karl Rahner.

It has always been considered to be among the most serious sins. Apostasy was regarded as unforgivable in the post-apostolic church. However, the magnitude of defections during the Decian persecutions in 250 compelled the church to apply its gospel of forgiveness to apostates.

In the church, the Spirit maintains the apostolic tradition as a living force through 1) worship, preaching, teaching, and a constantly renewed understanding and living of scripture; 2) a mission to the world to save and transform it; and 3) an unbroken continuity of faith and life, manifested in a particular way by the succession of bishops. The Anglican approach to apostolic tradition allows a great variety of attitudes and teaching.

Christians have practiced fasting and abstinence from meat on certain days. The monastic tradition identifies asceticism with patient bearing with one another, simplicity of life, and celibacy. A moderate asceticism is included in the rules of all religious communities. The vows of celibacy, poverty, and obedience subordinate asceticism to a life-long search for the kingdom.

Augustine was an opponent of the Donatists, who insisted on the purity of the clergy. He also opposed the Pelagians, who taught that people can live a sinless life and thus be saved.

Reason is understood to include the human capacity to discern the truth in both rational and intuitive ways. It is not limited to logic as such. It takes into account and includes experience. Each of the three sources of authority must be perceived and interpreted in light of the other two.&nbsp;<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\tThe Anglican balance of authority has been characterized as a &quot;three-legged stool&quot; which falls if any one of the legs is not upright. It may be distinguished from a tendency in Roman Catholicism to overemphasize tradition relative to scripture and reason, and in certain Protestant churches to overemphasize scripture relative to tradition and reason. The Anglican balancing of the sources of authority has been criticized as clumsy or &quot;muddy.&quot; It has been associated with the Anglican affinity for seeking the mean between extremes and living the via media. It has also been associated with the Anglican willingness to tolerate and comprehend opposing viewpoints instead of imposing tests of orthodoxy or resorting to heresy trials.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\tThis balanced understanding of authority is based in the theology of Richard Hooker (c. 1554-1600). It may be further traced to the teaching of Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274). Urban T. Holmes III (1930-1981) provided a thorough and helpful discussion of the sources of authority in his book What is Anglicanism? (1982).&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n",

Bach&apos;s musical production falls into three principal categories corresponding to the posts he held. He was born in Eisenach, Germany, and received his earliest musical training in choir schools in Ohrdruf and Luneburg. His early period consisted mainly of organ works while organist at Weimar. His next position, Kapellmeister to Prince Leopold of Cothen, produced works for instruments and orchestra including the Brandenburg Concertos. His prestigious post in Leipzig produced church works, a large output of cantatas, the St. John and St. Matthew passions, and the B minor Mass. Bach&apos;s association with the Lutheran chorale was not in composing new tunes but rather in harmonizing and embellishing the rich body of church song already in existence. Many of Bach&apos;s rich and ingenious harmonizations are included in today&apos;s hymnals, including The Hymnal 1982, which has twenty Bach chorale harmonizations. He died in Leipzig.",

God adopts us, making us members of the church and inheritors of the Kingdom of God (BCP, pp. 298, 858). In baptism we are made sharers in the new life of the Holy Spirit and the forgiveness of sins. Baptism is the foundation for all future church participation and ministry. Each candidate for <strong><a href=\"/baptism\">baptism</a></strong> in the Episcopal Church is to be sponsored by one or more baptized persons.Sponsors (godparents) speak on behalf of candidates for baptism who are infants or younger children and cannot speak for themselves at the Presentation and Examination of the Candidates. During the baptismal rite the members of the congregation promise to do all they can to support the candidates for baptism in their life in Christ. They join with the candidates by renewing the baptismal covenant. The water of baptism may be administered by immersion or affusin (pouring) (BCP, p. 307). Candidates are baptized &#8220;in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,&#8221; and then marked on the forehead with the sign of the cross. Chrism may be used for this marking. The newly baptized is &#8220;sealed by the Holy Spirit in Baptism and marked as Christ&#8217;s own for ever.&#8221; When all baptisms have been completed, the celebrant and congregation welcome the newly administered within the eucharist as the chief service on a Sunday or another feast.The Catechism notes that &#8220;Infants are baptized so that they can share citizenship in the Covenant, membership in Christ, and redemption by God.&#8221; The baptismal promises are made for infants by their parents or sponsors, &#8220;who guarantee that the infants will be brought up within the Church, to know Christ and be able to follow him&#8221; (BCP, pp. 858-859).

John focused primarily on the need for repentance and the importance of the future (eschatology). The early Christian community saw the fulfillment of John&apos;s promise in the Pentecost event (Acts 1:5). The gift of the Spirit was extended to converts through the response of faith, followed by baptism in the name of Jesus (Acts 2:38). While the reception of the Spirit is invariably associated with baptism, it occasionally precedes (Acts 10:44-48) or follows (Acts 8:14-17; 19:2-9) baptism. In holiness and Pentecostal traditions, &#8220;Spirit Baptism&#8221; or &#8220;Second Baptism&#8221; refers to an ecstatic experience distinct from conversion or justification in which the sanctification of the Spirit is bestowed. The Episcopal Church maintains that &#8220;Holy Baptism is full initiation by water and the Holy Spirit&#8221; into the church (BCP, p. 298). The Episcopal Church thus recognizes no baptism in or of the Spirit separate from or additional to sacramental initiation. See Baptism; see John the Baptist.",

        "The doctrine that at baptism the candidates are not only initiated into the Christian community but are also &#8220;born again.&#8221; That is, the Holy Spirit pours upon them the gift of new life. The doctrine is rooted in the NT. The Fourth Gospel states that &#8220;no one can enter the kingdom of God without being born of water and the Spirit . . . You must be born from above (or, born again)&#8221; (Jn 3:5-7). According to the BCP, candidates for Holy Baptism &#8220;receive the Sacrament of new birth&#8221; (p. 305), and are declared to have been &#8220;raised . . . to the new life of grace&#8221; (p. 308).&nbsp;Like the transformation of bread into the body of Christ at the eucharist, baptismal new life is &#8220;spiritually&#8221; discerned. The transformation of the baptized persons into participants in the risen life of Christ is not seen with ordinary vision. This transformation is seen with eyes opened by the Spirit. Baptismal regeneration, however, does not immediately or necessarily result in moral betterment. Confusion on this point accounts for numerous controversies on this subject which have occurred in the history of the church. The Rev. Charles E. Cheney, rector of Christ Church, Chicago, refused to use the word &#8220;regeneration&#8221; in the baptismal service.

The vision of God serves as the primary metaphor for the end of the Christian life in monastic traditions, mysticism, and Thomism. It has been understood as an immediate knowledge of God. It is not a theoretical knowledge but a personal knowledge of the incomprehensible mystery and love of God. The beatific vision may be understood as another expression for the highest good (or summum bonum), perfect fulfillment in God, and eternal life.

The most quoted beatitudes are at the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount in the Gospel of Matthew and in the Sermon on the Plain in Luke. These beatitudes are spoken by Jesus to his disciples. The beatitudes are usually interpreted as paradox, comparing the difference between present and future. Those who suffer or are poor now are blessed (or happy) because they are destined to be saved in the future when the Kingdom arrives.

When Archbishop Theobald died in 1161, Henry saw an opportunity to extend his authority over the church by having Becket become archbishop. Becket was consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury on June 3, 1162. He immediately became a great defender of the rights and liberties of the church. He and Henry disagreed over a number of church/state issues, and Becket fled to France. After a reconciliation with the King in 1170, he returned to Canterbury. But they were soon in conflict again. On Dec. 29, 1170, Becket was murdered by four overzealous knights who overheard the king murmur that someone should rid him of the archbishop. He was canonized by the Roman Catholic Church in 1173, and his shrine was a major pilgrimage destination until it was destroyed by King Henry VIII in 1538.

He was ordained deacon in 1848 and priest in 1849. In 1850 he became vicar of Cowley, two miles from Oxford. A sermon preached by John Keble at Wantage on July 22, 1863, moved him to think about founding a community for men. On Dec. 27, 1866, Benson, Simeon Wilberforce O&apos;Neill, and Charles Chapman Grafton founded the Society of St. John the Evangelist. Each took a life vow of celibacy, poverty, and obedience. In Nov. 1870 Benson went to the United States and established a branch house in Boston. He served as superior of the order, 1866-1890.",

An angel of the Lord told Joseph in a dream not to be afraid to take Mary home as his wife because the child was conceived by the Holy Spirit (Mt 1:18-20). Betrothal is now archaic. The term does not appear in the BCP. However, the Declaration of Consent in the marriage service may be understood as a final ratification of the engagement (BCP, p. 424).

        "An informal intercessory prayer, covering a wide variety of concerns such as the church, the state, the living and the dead, and public and private necessities. It followed the sermon and the dismissal of the catechumens in the early church. The celebrant bid a particular intention of prayer, and the congregation joined in silent prayer for a short time until the celebrant summed up the congregation&apos;s prayers with a collect. Another bidding would follow, until the bidding prayer was concluded. The bidding prayer is the oldest form of intercessory prayer and has traditionally been said in the language of the people. It was replaced by the litany in the sixth century, and the litany later fell into disuse. The bidding prayer subsequently appeared as an unofficial group of intercessions in the Latin Rite in the middle ages. It was known as the &#8220;bidding of the bedes,&#8221; which means the praying of the prayers. The bidding prayer was flexible, and it could be adapted at the discretion of the celebrant. It was later formalized. In some places it preceded the sermon. Although the 1549 Prayer Book restored liturgical intercession, an Anglican canon of 1604 required a formal bidding prayer before the sermon. The 1928 BCP included a bidding prayer for use before sermons or on special occasions. The minister had discretion to shorten or lengthen the prayer. The ancient bidding prayer is reflected in the solemn collects of the Good Friday liturgy (BCP, pp. 278-280).",

The BCP (p. 855) notes that the bishop is &#8220;to act in Christ&apos;s name for the reconciliation of the world and the building up of the church; and to ordain others to continue Christ&apos;s ministry.&#8221; Bishops stand in the apostolic succession, maintaining continuity in the present with the ministry of the Apostles. Bishops serve as chief pastors of the church, exercising a ministry of oversight and supervision. Diocesan bishops hold jurisdiction in their dioceses, with particular responsibility for the doctrine, discipline, and worship of the church. Bishops serve as the focus for diocesan unity and for the unity of their dioceses with the wider church. Since the bishop&apos;s ministry is a ministry of oversight, the term &#8220;episcopal&#8221; (derived from the Greek episcopos, &#8220;overseer&#8221;) is applied to matters pertaining to bishops. An &#8220;episcopal&#8221; church is a church governed by bishops, and &#8220;episcopal&#8221; services are led by bishops.

He was ordained in the Church of Scotland in late June or early July, 1679. He moved to England and was ordained in the Church of England. In 1685 the Bishop of London offered him the rectorship of the parish of Henrico, then called Varina, in the colony of Virginia. On Dec. 15, 1689, the Bishop of London named Blair the Commissary to Virginia. As Commissary he wielded little official authority within the colony, but he did have great influence upon several of the governors. He began the practice of calling the clergy of the colony together for conventions. Blair looked out for the interests of the clergy and churches in the colony, and worked successfully for better salaries for clergy. Blair also sought morally sound and reliable priests for the parishes, and he fought to retain the rights of the vestries to appoint their own clergy rather than submit to royal appointments. His greatest contribution was the founding of the College of William and Mary. In 1691 he went to England to petition the King and Queen for the college. On Feb. 8, 1693, the charter was granted. In the charter Blair was named president of the college &#8220;during his natural life.&#8221; In 1694 he became the minister of the church in Jamestown. In 1710 he became the rector of Bruton Parish in Williamsburg, where he remained until his death. He was also the president of William and Mary until his death. Blair died in Williamsburg.",

The BCP prescribes forms of blessing to be used by a bishop or priest prior to the dismissal in Rite 1 eucharistic liturgies. Although no form of blessing is required in the Rite 2 eucharistic liturgies, all four Rite 2 eucharistic prayers allow a blessing at the conclusion of the service. The BOS provides Seasonal Blessings, which may be used by a bishop or priest whenever a blessing is appropriate. A nuptial blessing of the husband and wife concludes the Celebration and Blessing of a Marriage (BCP, pp. 430-431). The Reconciliation of a Penitent, Form One, begins with a blessing of the penitent by the priest. The deacon may be blessed by the celebrant before reading or singing the gospel at the eucharist. Individuals may also be blessed by a bishop or priest outside the context of a liturgy for pastoral reasons. The BOS provides a form for the Blessing of a Pregnant Woman, which may be done privately. 2) A blessing may also be used to consecrate or dedicate something to holy use. The celebrant blesses the water to be used in baptism (BCP, pp. 306-307). The elements of the eucharist are blessed in the prayer of consecration. The BCP provides a form for the blessing of oil for the Anointing of the Sick (p. 455), and for the consecration by a bishop of the oil of chrism for use in baptism (p. 307). Wedding rings may be blessed at the Celebration and Blessing of a Marriage (p. 427). The new fire is blessed at the Lighting of the Paschal candle in the Great Vigil of Easter (BCP, p. 285).

It is a Celtic lorica, or breastplate prayer, which was recited while dressing or arming for physical or spiritual battle. The text invokes the Trinity, angels, apostles, patriarchs, prophets, the powers of heaven and earth, and Christ to be present for protection in all times and situations of life. The hymn strongly emphasizes personal commitment, awareness of God in everyday events &#8220;today,&#8221; and Christ&apos;s pervasive presence. The text is ascribed to St. Patrick (c. 390-c. 460). It is very unlikely but not impossible that St. Patrick wrote it. The earliest copy of the text dates from the ninth century, and it may well have been written in the sixth century or earlier. Cecil Frances Alexander (1818-1895) translated the metrical English version of the text that appears in The Hymnal 1982. She originally prepared this expanded paraphrase of the text for the 1891 revision of the Irish Church Hymnal. The hymn was completed in time to be sung throughout Ireland on St. Patrick&apos;s Day, Mar. 17, 1889. It is now frequently used on Trinity Sunday because of its powerful invocation of the Trinity.

Some of the features of the broad church attitude were a desire that the church should contribute to the welfare of the life of the English nation, as opposed to the individualism of the low church party and the ecclesiastical emphasis of the high churchmen; an openness to reason as a mediator of religious truth, as opposed to the exclusive reliance on scripture and tradition in the other parties, with particular interest in the new teaching of the German idealist philosophers; and a passion for rigorous morality and social justice. The broad church movement desired the Church of England to be comprehensive rather than exclusive. Those identified with the broad church movement in its early years considered it to be above parties-hence &quot;broad.&quot; Within a generation, the impossibility of such a view was commonly discerned.

In 1935 he became instructor in church music and organist at the General Theological Seminary in New York, a post he held until his retirement in 1963. During those years he also served as organist and choirmaster of several New York area parishes. At General Seminary he was known as a person of great compassion. In 1949 Oxford University Press (New York) published The Oxford American Psalter in which his pointing of the psalms reflected his advocacy of &#8220;speech rhythm&#8221; chanting, a method of pointing developed in England earlier in the century. The principles established by Brown in his work in chant at General Seminary influenced the pointing of Anglican chant in The Book of Canticles, The Hymnal 1982, and The Anglican Chant Psalter. Brown served on the Tunes Committee for The Hymnal (1940). The Hymnal 1982 contains one tune, &#8220;Chelsea Square&#8221; (521), which he harmonized and one Anglican chant (S 214) which he composed. Brown died in New York City. The Anglican Chant Psalter was dedicated to his memory.",

        "Bruton Parish, Williamsburg, Virginia",
        " An important pre-Revolutionary parish. It had a strong association with both the College of William and Mary and the colonial government of Virginia. In 1632 or 1633, the parish of Middler Plantation was formed. In 1658 it was combined, by act of the Colonial Assembly, with Harrop Parish to form the new parish of Middletown. The first building was completed around 1660. In 1674 the parishes of Middletown and Marston were combined to form Bruton Parish, named for the town of Bruton in Sussex, England, the ancestral home of the governor, Sir William Berkeley. It is assumed that the 1660 structure was of wood, since in 1677, by order of the vestry, a brick structure was to be built. This building was completed on Nov. 29, 1683. In 1699 the colonial government of Virginia was moved from Jamestown to Williamsburg and Bruton Parish became the court church. Church and state were united in Virginia in colonial times and office holders were required to attend church regularly.   In 1706 the vestry again ordered a new, larger church to be built. It requested that the government contribute to defray costs. The governor, Alexander Spotswood, agreed to supply the bricks and to pay for twenty-two of the seventy-five feet length of the building. The building was completed in 1715. It has remained in continuous use. Other additions were made by 1769, but no subsequent additions have been made to the exterior. In 1744 the vestry suggested that the General Assembly purchase an organ for the church. In 1752 the church was enlarged and what is believed to be the first church organ in the colonies was installed. During the Civil War, the congregation went &#8220;underground&#8221; to avoid praying for the President of the United States, as ordered by the Federal commander. The building was used as a hospital. Restoration of the building was begun in 1905 and again in 1960.",

When there is communion at the Burial of the Dead, the commendation and the committal follow the communion of the people and the postcommunion prayer (BCP, pp. 482, 498). The burial rites also include the Apostles&apos; Creed, a special form of the prayers of the people, forms for the consecration of the grave, and additional prayers that may be added after the Lord&apos;s Prayer.

The BOS provides appropriate texts for the burial of a person who was not a baptized Christian or who rejected the Christian faith. The burial office is an Easter liturgy. The liturgical color is appropriately white, and the Paschal candle should be lighted as a visible reminder of Jesus&apos; resurrection and our hope of life everlasting in Christ.

He was sent to Paris at about age fourteen to study in the university. He was apparently headed for an ecclesiastical career and the study of theology. Calvin received a Master of Arts degree in 1528. In that year his father ordered him to study law. Calvin studied civil law at Orléans and Bourges. After his father&apos;s death, Calvin returned to Paris for work in classical studies and Hebrew. By 1533 he was converted to Protestantism. He fled to Basle, Switzerland, from France in 1535. Calvin published the first edition of his Institutes of the Christian Religion in 1536. The last edition of the Institutes was published in 1559. His teaching emphasized the sovereignty of God, scripture as the supreme rule of faith and life, the total depravity of humanity after the Fall, the predestination of the elect to salvation and the reprobate to damnation, and the importance of the church as an ordered and disciplined community. The ministers or officers of the Reformed Church included pastors, teachers, elders, and deacons. Calvin&apos;s reform is especially associated with the city of Geneva, Switzerland. In July, 1536, Guillaume Farel (1489-1565) convinced Calvin to stay in Geneva to organize the Reformation. Calvin and Farel were expelled from Geneva in 1538, but the city council invited Calvin to return in 1541. Calvin worked to establish a theocracy in Geneva. He lived in Geneva and dominated the religious life of the city until his death. Calvinism influenced the French Huguenots, the Scottish Church reforms of John Knox (c. 1513-1572), the Puritans in England, and the reformed churches in the Netherlands. Calvinism came to dominate the Protestant movement of reform. Calvin&apos;s influence is also seen in the American Reformed, Congregational, and Presbyterian churches.",

The term also indicates one who is in the final stage of the canonical process leading to ordination as a deacon or priest. After an applicant (aspirant) for holy orders has been admitted as a postulant for six months, the postulant may apply to the bishop for admission as a candidate for holy orders. Candidacy follows postulancy and precedes ordination. The time of candidacy is to be at least one year, although this may be shortened to not less than six months. During this time the candidate is to complete or satisfy the canonical requirements for ordination, including requirements concerning age, education, academic examination, practical training or experience in ministry, and medical and psychological examinations. Also during this time a certificate of the candidate&apos;s fitness for ordination is sent from the rector and vestry of the candidate&apos;s parish to the standing committee of the diocese. A similar certificate is then sent by the standing committee to the bishop. A report from the diocesan commission on ministry is also sent to the bishop. In the case of one who is to be ordained deacon and later ordained priest, a certificate concerning the candidate&apos;s scholastic record and an evaluation concerning the candidate&apos;s personal qualifications for holy orders is sent to the bishop by the candidate&apos;s theological school or those who have directed the candidate&apos;s studies.

        "Candles",
        "Candles have extensive ceremonial use in the Christian liturgical tradition. Lighted candles may be seen to symbolize the light of Christ, or the light of the gospel, or simply to remind the congregation that the time and space for worship are sacred. Candles provide illumination that enhances the beauty of the church, and may provide additional light for worship. Candles may be carried in procession by acolytes, and held as the gospel is said or sung. Candles may be placed on the altar, or on a reredos behind the altar, or on pavement lights beside the altar. The BCP provides for the lighting of the altar candles at certain times in special services. At the Easter Vigil, the altar candles are lighted after the Renewal of Baptismal Vows and before the Easter Acclamation, &quot;Alleluia. Christ is risen&quot; (BCP, p. 204). Candles are lighted after the dedication of the altar by the bishop at the Consecration of a Church (BCP, p. 574). At the Order of Worship for the Evening, the lighting of the altar candles and other candles follows the Prayer for Light and precedes the hymn &quot;O Gracious Light&quot; (Phos hilaron). (BCP, p. 112). The BOS provides a variety of anthems (Lucernaria) at the candle lighting for optional use at the Order of Worship for the Evening, including seasonal anthems. Certain candles have special liturgical uses. The Paschal candle is a large, decorated candle that symbolizes the light of Christ who was crucified, died, rose, and ascended into heaven. It is lighted at the Easter Vigil, and at all services during the season of Easter. The Advent Wreath has four candles that represent the four Sundays of the season of Advent, and may also include a &quot;Christ candle&quot; that is lighted on Christmas Eve. A candle may be given to each of the newly baptized or a godparent after baptism. This candle may be lighted from the Paschal candle, and it serves as a reminder of baptism. Candles may be lighted and extinguished with a candle taper. Candles are often used as a sign of festivity and solemnity in Christian worship. The use of such lights has a long and varied tradition. Acts 20 records that there were &quot;many lights&quot; at the service at Troas when Paul and other Christians gathered to break bread. Lamps and candles were in normal use in Christian worship by the fourth century, but for many years it was not customary to place candles on the altar. The first known mention of the use of altar lights was a twelfth-century report that two candles flanked an altar cross in the papal chapel. The injunction of Edward VI in 1547 called for there to be two lights on the high altar &quot;for the signification that Christ is the very true light of the world.&quot; Candles have been used in some English cathedrals and churches since the seventeenth century. The use of candles at the eucharist was disputed in the Church of England and in the Episcopal Church during the nineteenth century. During the years of the ritualist controversy in the Episcopal Church, the General Conventions of 1868, 1871, and 1874 considered proposals to prohibit the use of altar candles. Use of candles in worship was strongly favored by Episcopalians of the catholic tradition and resisted by those of the evangelical tradition. The use of altar candles was never prohibited by General Convention. Use of altar lights and other candles in the worship of the church is now customary. Some BCP services make special provision for the use of candles in worship. The Easter Vigil service begins with the lighting of the Paschal candle, which is to burn at all services from Easter Day through Pentecost (BCP, pp. 285-287). In an Order of Worship for the Evening, the candle lighting follows the Prayer for Light (p. 112).",

On Feb. 2, 1865, Sister Harriett and several other women were received into the Sisterhood of St. Mary, now called the Community of St. Mary. Their service of religious profession was presided over by Bishop Horatio Potter of New York at St. Michael&apos;s Church, Manhattan. Sister Harriett was elected mother superior in Sept. 1865.

The canons of the Episcopal Church are enacted by the General Convention. Canons of the Episcopal Church may only be enacted, amended, or repealed by concurrent resolution of the House of Deputies and the House of Bishops at General Convention. The canons of the Episcopal Church are organized by titles or sections concerning Organization and Administration, Worship, Ministry, Ecclesiastical Discipline, and General Provisions. 3) [Ecclesiastical Title] A canon may be a member of the clergy on the staff of a cathedral or diocese. A canon on a cathedral staff assists the dean, and a canon on a diocesan staff assists the bishop. Members of the clergy and laity have at times been made honorary canons of a cathedral in recognition of significant service or achievement. Historically, canons were secular clergy who were connected to a cathedral or collegiate church, sharing the revenues and a common rule of life at the church. 4) [Liturgy] The canon designates the fixed portion of the Great Thanksgiving or the prayer of consecration at the Holy Eucharist, including the institution narrative. The canon does not vary with the liturgical season. 5) [Church Music] A musical composition, with a note-for-note imitation of one melodic line by another that begins one or more notes later than the first, also known as a round.

The Christian monastic Daily Office, with prayers or hours at seven times in each day, was based on the Jewish pattern of daily prayer at sunrise and at other times.

It expressed agreement upon such matters as the origins of sacramental ordination, emergence of the threefold ministry, relationship of the ordained ministry to the laity, the concept of episcope, relationship of ordination to eucharistic presidency, evolution of priestly terminology, the meaning of ordination, indelibility of holy orders, and the nature of apostolic succession. The statement concluded that the negative judgment of the Roman Catholic Church on Anglican Orders (1896) was now placed in a new context and that the commission had reached consensus on essential matters. An &#8220;Elucidation&#8221; issued by the commission in 1979 considered that the principles upon which its doctrinal agreement rested were not affected by the ordination of women, since it had been &#8220;concerned with the origin and nature of the ordained ministry and not with the question of who can or cannot be ordained.&#8221; The 1979 General Convention of the Episcopal Church went on to affirm that the Canterbury Statement &#8220;provide[s] a basis upon which to proceed in furthering the growth towards unity of the Episcopal Church with the Roman Catholic Church.&#8221; The official response of the 1988 Lambeth Conference also found the Canterbury Statement, together with the Elucidation, to be &#8220;consonant in substance with the faith of Anglicans&#8221; and &#8220;a sufficient basis for taking the next step forward towards the reconciliation of our Churches grounded in agreement in faith.&#8221; The Vatican&apos;s definitive response to the Final Report, however, finally released in 1991, raised a number of objections.",

        "For Thomas Aquinas (1224-1274), the cardinal virtues form the basis for moral growth and development in all persons, although for Christians they can only be understood and fully achieved through God&apos;s grace as given in the theological virtues. Initially stated in Book Four of Plato&apos;s Republic, Aristotle develops the cardinal virtues in his Ethics as moral virtues, the perfection of human powers as they lead to happiness. Translating from the Greek, the cardinal virtues are referred to in English as wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice. Translating the equivalent English from Latin, they are referred to as prudence, fortitude, temperance, and justice. Prudence is the perfection of the intellect as a matter of practical wisdom. It concerns knowing what to do and when to do it. Fortitude is the perfection of the will in terms of being neither timid nor foolhardy but holding steadfast to what needs to be done. Temperance is the perfection of the appetites, seeking enough but not too much. Justice is the perfection of the whole in which the parts are fairly balanced in relationship to the whole. In the fourth century Ambrose assumed this understanding of the cardinal virtues in his instruction for the clergy in De Officiis Ministrorum. Other theologians, most notably Augustine in On the Morals of the Catholic Church, tie the human virtues to the ultimate end of the love of God. Thomas draws this thought to its most systematic formulation in his Summa Theologica, which became the basis for subsequent Roman Catholic thought. It was also the source for much of Anglican thought at the time of the English Reformation and in Anglo-catholic moral theology arising from the Oxford Movement.",

While at General Seminary, Carey was associated with St. Peter&apos;s Church, New York City. Carey taught in the Sunday School. The Rev. Hugh Smith was the rector of St. Peter&apos;s. When Carey&apos;s ordination to the diaconate approached, Smith refused to sign the canonical testimonies because he thought Carey was too sympathetic to Roman Catholicism. Carey then received the necessary testimonials from the Rev. William Berrian, rector of Trinity Church, New York. Meanwhile, Smith convinced the Rev. Henry Anthon, rector of St. Mark&apos;s Church, to join him in opposing Carey&apos;s ordination. Bishop Benjamin T. Onderdonk of New York arranged for Smith and Anthon to assist at an examination of Carey before him and six other presbyters of the diocese.

The volume and character of the sound may be controlled by the force the carilloneur uses to strike the note. A few carillons are also linked to electrical activators which may be played from an organ console, but this is discouraged since touch control of the mechanism is lost. Carillon bells are tuned internally, usually in minor keys. The keyboard is played with hands and fists. There are more than 160 carillons in the United States, and many are in Episcopal churches. Those at the National Cathedral, Washington, D.C.; the University of the South, Sewanee, Tennessee; and Christ Church, Cranbrook, Michigan, are among the best known. Some churches use electronic instruments which simulate the sound of bells.",

Casuistry arises from conflicts of conscience where in a particular situation more than one course of action appears good or bad, right or wrong. Called &#8220;cases of conscience,&#8221; casuistry sees moral reasoning and judgment as evolving as new circumstances lead to new choices. The critique of the abuse of casuistry, most notably by Blaise Pascal in the seventeenth century, has given casuistry a negative connotation associated with subtle distinctions and twisted logic. But casuistry has a much broader tradition, including casuistic study of the Talmud by Jewish rabbis and Islamic application of the Koran. Christian casuistry began in the late sixth century with the development of penitentials and reached its culmination in moral theology as shaped by the thought of Thomas Aquinas. Protestants rejected penitential confession, given its abuse in a system of penances and indulgences, and they also rejected the Roman Catholic casuistic tradition. However, the English Puritans and the Anglicans of the seventeenth century developed a casuistic tradition. Most notable among Anglicans are Jeremy Taylor&apos;s Ductor Dubitantium (1660) and the work of twentieth-century Anglican moralist Kenneth Kirk. A contemporary renewal of casuistry began in the development of biomedical ethics. It has continued in other areas such as business ethics and professional ethics.",

These services concluded with the laying on of hands by the teacher, even if the teacher was a lay person. The teacher was known as a catechist.

The catechumenate is a time for training in Christian understandings about God, human relationships, and the meaning of life. According to Hippolytus&apos;s Apostolic Tradition, a third-century document, adult converts to the Christian faith were presented to teachers by those who could vouch for them, and entered into a three-year period of study and preparation in the catechumenate. These &#8220;hearers,&#8221; or catechumens, attended services of readings, instructions, and prayers which concluded with the laying on of hands by the teacher. They were trained in Christian doctrine and morals. Catechumens were admitted as candidates after three years in the catechumenate when their faith, life, and understanding indicated their readiness for baptism. Candidates were enrolled at the beginning of Lent and entered into an intense time of instruction in the gospel and of daily exorcisms prior to their baptism at Easter. The catechumenate is now being revived in the Episcopal church. It is marked by three stages: 1) During the Pre-catechumenal period, inquirers may test their desire for baptism. 2) Those desiring baptism may be admitted to the catechumenate. Entry into the catechumenate begins with a public liturgical act at the principal Sunday liturgy. Each catechumen is presented by a sponsor who normally accompanies the catechumen through the process of candidacy and serves as a sponsor at baptism. Catechumens participate in regular worship and Christian service and receive instruction in Christian faith and doctrine, including the scriptures. The instructional sessions are led by a catechist, and continue through the period of candidacy until baptism. These sessions conclude with a time of silence, prayers for the catechumens by other baptized persons who are present, and prayers and the laying of a hand on the head of each catechumen by the catechist. 3) Candidacy for baptism is normally a period of six weeks, marked by a series of liturgical acts on the Sundays leading up to the baptism. Candidates for baptism at the Great Vigil of Easter are normally enrolled on the First Sunday of Lent. Candidates to be baptized on the First Sunday after Epiphany are enrolled on the First Sunday of Advent. The BOS provides liturgical forms for the catechumenate, including a form for the admission of catechumens, prayers for use at the conclusion of sessions of instruction during the catechumenate and the period of candidacy, a form for the enrollment of candidates for baptism, and prayers and blessings for use before the prayers of the people during the period of candidacy. When candidates are enrolled, their names are written in a large book and the celebrant prays, &#8220;God grant that they may also be written in the Book of Life.&#8221; See Apostolic Tradition; see Christian Formation; see Sponsor (at Baptism).",

It states that they hold marriage to be a lifelong union; that they believe this union in heart, body, and mind is intended by God for their mutual joy, for help and comfort given one another in prosperity and adversity, and for the procreation (when it is God&#8217;s will) of children and their Christian nurture. There must be at least two witnesses for the ceremony. A priest or bishop normally presides at the marriage. If no priest or bishop is available, a deacon can preside if permitted by civil law. A deacon presiding at the marriage would omit the nuptial blessing. The marriage may be celebrated and blessed in the context of a nuptial eucharist. The marriage service then replaces the ministry of the word, and the eucharist begins with the offertory. Any authorized liturgy for the eucharist may be used with the marriage service. Prior to the service, the Banns of Marriage may be posted to announce the upcoming marriage and insure that there is no impediment. The title &#8220;Celebration and Blessing of a Marriage&#8221; in the 1979 BCP replaces the earlier title, &#8220;The Form of Solemnization of Matrimony.&#8221; See <a href=\"/library/glossary/marriage\">Marriage</a>.",

After the procession has returned to the living room, or immediately after the homily and invocation if there is no procession, the service continues with the Blessing of the Home. This blessing includes an antiphon, a versicle and response, a prayer of blessing, and the peace. The service may continue with the eucharist.

It may be used for the installation of deans and canons of cathedrals, or the induction of other diocesan or parochial ministries, including assistant ministers and vicars of missions (BCP, p. 558). It may also be used for the institution of deacons and lay persons with pastoral responsibilities. The bishop is normally the chief minister, but a deputy may be appointed if necessary. The BCP provides a form for the Letter of Institution of a Minister (p. 557), which is appropriate for the induction of the rector of a parish, the dean of a cathedral, or a similar office. The Letter of Institution may be read by the bishop after the wardens state that the new minister is well qualified, and that he or she has been prayerfully and lawfully selected. The Litany for Ordinations or another appropriate litany precedes the collect and the liturgy of the word. This service includes an induction ceremony in which the bishop, representatives of the congregation, and representatives of the diocesan clergy present symbolic gifts to the new minister. The BCP calls for the presentations to include a Bible for proclaiming the Word, a vessel of water for baptizing, a stole or symbol of the new minister&apos;s order, a book of prayers, olive oil for healing and reconciliation, the keys of the church (if the new minister is a rector or vicar), the Constitution and Canons of the Church, and bread and wine for the eucharist (pp. 561-562). These presentations may be added to, omitted, or adapted in light of the order of the new minister and the nature of the new ministry. The priest&apos;s prayer (BCP, pp. 562-563) is appropriate only for rectors, deans, vicars, hospital chaplains, and other priests with similar canonical charge. The new ministry is celebrated in the context of a eucharist. The bishop is normally the chief celebrant. The new minister, if a priest, concelebrates the eucharist with the bishop and other clergy. This service takes the place of an earlier form in American Prayer Books titled &#8220;An Office of Institution of Ministers into Parishes or Churches.&#8221;",

An eclectic liturgy mixed Roman and Gallic rituals and kept the Jewish computation of Easter. Missionary zeal led to the founding of monasteries in continental Europe. Through the influence of Celtic spirituality, a monastic practice of individual confession and of satisfaction proportional to the offense became normative for the sacrament of penance in the whole western church. In 665 the Synod of Whitby abandoned Celtic customs for those of Rome. Yet great works of art (The Book of Kells, c. 775-800) testified to a persistent religious perception that was unique in Christendom. The monastic rule of St. Columba (c. 543-615) gave way gradually to the more moderate rule of St. Benedict.",

Clement of Alexandria, developing the thought of Eph 1:13, speaks of the &#8220;shining character of righteousness&#8221; imprinted on the soul of the Christian by Christ himself, a quality of life which participates in the Holy Spirit. This idea was amplified by St. Augustine. In medieval scholastic theology baptism was said to confer an indelible character upon those who received it. The BCP states that &#8220;The bond which God establishes in Baptism is indissoluble&#8221; (p. 298). It is this character, this indissoluble bond, which makes baptism unrepeatable. In the same way, medieval scholastics held that confirmation and ordination conferred indelible character. Contemporary Anglican theology appears to reject this view in the case of Confirmation, recognizing no separate character of Confirmation apart from the baptismal character. Although the Episcopal Church makes no such specific claim about ordination, it acts as though ordination were indelible. One who has abandoned or renounced the ordained ministry, or even been deposed from it, is not reordained if he or she is reinstated. Instead, the person is formally restored to the order already held.",

Certain gifts are specifically associated with offices or ministries in the church, including the charismata given to apostles, prophets, teachers, workers of miracles, healers, helpers, administrators, and those who speak in tongues (1 Cor 12:28). In view of the great and changing variety of ministries in the church, such lists of charismata must not be considered to be exhaustive. The term &#8220;charismata&#8221; is also used to indicate the remarkable signs of God&apos;s blessing that empowered the early church, beginning at Pentecost (Acts 2:1-4).

Pentecostalism refers to churches and movements that claim to re-experience the spiritual gifts associated with the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost in Acts, especially the gift of tongues. The experience is usually referred to as &#8220;Baptism in the Holy Spirit.&#8221; In 1953 Agnes Sanford was one of the first in the Episcopal Church to have such a Pentecostal experience. She was a noted healer and activist in the Order of Saint Luke. Richard Winkler, rector of Trinity Episcopal Church, Wheaton, Illinois, also had such an experience at about this time. He began holding meetings in his home and later in the parish. Winkler was also a member of the Order of Saint Luke. In 1959 several California parishes witnessed Pentecostal experiences, including St. Luke&apos;s, Monrovia, St. Mark&apos;s, Van Nuys, and Holy Spirit, Monterey Park. Dennis Bennet was at this time rector of St. Mark&apos;s, Van Nuys, and Frank Maguire was vicar of Holy Spirit, Monterey Park. Dennis Bennet and his wife Rita quickly emerged as leaders of the new movement, along with Jean Stone Willans of St. Mark&apos;s. Willans founded the Blessed Trinity Society in 1961 and its Logos magazine to promote charismatic renewal in mainline denominations. Also during this period the Cathedral of St. Paul in Detroit became involved in the charismatic movement under the leadership of Dean John Weaver. Episcopalians involved in the charismatic movement have often not shared the more fundamentalistic theology of those involved in classical Pentecostalism. By the 1990s, the charismatic movement in the Episcopal Church was largely organized through Episcopal Renewal Ministries.",

        "Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral",
        "Statement of the four Anglican essentials for a reunited Christian Church. It concerns the scriptures, creeds, sacraments, and the historic episcopate. It was approved by the House of Bishops at the 1886 General Convention in Chicago, and subsequently approved with modifications by the bishops of the Anglican Communion at the Lambeth Conference of 1888. A primary source for the Quadrilateral was The Church-Idea, An Essay Towards Unity (1870) by William Reed Huntington (1838-1909), an Episcopal priest. He indicated the Anglican basis for an ecumenical &quot;Church of the Reconciliation&quot; in America should be acceptance of l) the Holy Scriptures as the Word of God; 2) the Nicene Creed as the rule of faith; 3) the two sacraments ordained by Christ himself (baptism and the eucharist); and 4) the episcopate as the keystone of governmental unity in the church. This &quot;foursquare&quot; approach became known as the &quot;Quadrilateral.&quot; Huntington was the moving force behind its approval by the House of Bishops in Chicago. The Chicago version of the Quadrilateral provides an ecumenical statement of purpose and introduction which states that the Episcopal Church is &quot;ready in the spirit of love and humility to forego all preferences of her own&quot; concerning things of human ordering or choice regarding modes of worship, discipline, and traditional customs. However, the statement of purpose warns that Christian unity &quot;can be restored only by the return of all Christian communions to the principles of unity exemplified by the undivided Catholic Church during the first days of its existence.&quot; The four points of the Quadrilateral were listed by the Chicago statement as &quot;inherent parts&quot; of the sacred deposit of Christian faith and order &quot;committed by Christ and his Apostles to the Church unto the end of the world, and therefore incapable of compromise or surrender. . . .&quot; The Chicago statement lists the Nicene Creed as the sufficient statement of the Christian faith. With respect to baptism and the eucharist, the Chicago statement calls for administration of these sacraments &quot;with unfailing use of Christ&#039;s words of institution and of the elements ordained by Him.&quot; The Chicago version expressed the fourth part of the Quadrilateral in terms of &quot;The Historic Episcopate, locally adapted in the methods of its administration to the varying needs of the nations and peoples called of God into the unity of His Church.&quot; Although the Quadrilateral was not enacted by the House of Deputies at the 1886 General Convention, it was incorporated in a general plan referred for study and action by the newly created Joint Commission on Christian Reunion. The Quadrilateral was passed in a modified form as &quot;Resolution II&quot; of the Lambeth Conference of 1888. At Lambeth the four essential &quot;parts&quot; were termed &quot;Articles.&quot; The introductory statement of purpose of the Chicago version of the Quadrilateral was deleted and replaced by a simple statement that the four Articles &quot;supply a basis on which approach may be by God&#039;s blessing made towards Home Reunion. . . .&quot; The Lambeth version states that the scriptures provide &quot;the rule and ultimate standard of faith.&quot; The Lambeth text affirms the Nicene Creed as the &quot;sufficient statement of the Christian faith&quot; but also adds the &quot;Apostles&#039; Creed, as the Baptismal Symbol&quot; to the creedal article of the Quadrilateral. The Lambeth version adds the statement that the dominical sacraments of Baptism and Eucharist were &quot;instituted by Christ himself.&quot; The article concerning the historic episcopate was not changed at Lambeth. At the 1895 General Convention of the Episcopal Church, the Commission on Christian Unity was continued with the goal of seeking Christian unity on the basis of the &quot;principles enunciated throughout the Declaration of the house of Bishops made at Chicago in 1886, and as reaffirmed by the Lambeth Conference of 1888.&quot; Thus for the first time the entire General Convention of the Episcopal Church affirmed the Quadrilateral in its Lambeth form. The Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral has continued to serve as the primary Anglican working document and reference point for ecumenical Christian reunion. The Chicago and Lambeth versions of the Quadrilateral are included in the historical documents of the 1979 BCP (pp. 876-878). &nbsp;",

He persuaded the General Convention of 1931 to authorize the publication of the Historical Magazine of the Protestant Episcopal Church, now called Anglican and Episcopal History. Chorley published many articles on the history of the Episcopal Church and six books. Among his books are The New American Prayer Book-Its History and Contents (1929), and Quarter of a Millennium: Trinity Church in the City of New York, 1697-1947 (1947).

The Apostles&#039; Creed also states that Jesus descended to the dead, or hell, after his crucifixion and before the resurrection (see BCP, pp. 66, 120). The Council of Chalcedon (451) affirmed that the one person of Christ has two natures, divine and human, which are &quot;in no way annulled by the union,&quot; and that Christ&#039;s divine and human natures are &quot;without confusion, without change, without division, without separation.&quot; The Chalcedonian Definition also held that Christ is of one substance (homoousios) with God the Father concerning his divinity and of one substance with us concerning his humanity (see BCP, p. 864). The Christian hope is centered in the victorious Christ, who will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and whose kingdom will have no end (see BCP, pp. 120, 359). The Athanasian Creed states that at Jesus&#039; coming all humanity &quot;shall rise again with their bodies and shall give account for their own works&quot; (BCP, p. 865). The Christian assurance is that nothing, not even death, will separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord (Rom 8:38-39; BCP, p. 862).",

        "The City of Alexandria was founded in 1749, and a chapel-of-ease, or branch church for the ease of parishioners distant from the main parish church at Falls Church, Virginia, was located there by 1753. In 1765 the growth of local population led the Virginia legislature to divide the parish, which included Alexandria, into two. A new parish was created out of the northern end of Truro Parish and named Fairfax Parish. The vestry of Truro Parish decided that the main church at Falls Church and the chapel-of-ease at Alexandria were inadequate and would be replaced. Two similar churches were built from one set of plans at those two locations. The church built at Alexandria is Christ Church today. The construction of the Georgian-style church began in 1767 and was completed in 1773. The first services in this building were celebrated on Feb. 27, 1773. The galleries were added in 1787. Virginia Theological Seminary used Christ Church buildings at first, as did Episcopal High School. George Washington was a parishioner at Christ Church. However, he served on the vestry of Truro Parish where his home, Mt. Vernon, was located. He once bought and then rented a pew in Christ Church. Washington attended services at Christ Church when he was in Alexandria. Robert E. Lee was confirmed at Christ Church and married Mary Custis, Washington&apos;s step-great granddaughter, at Christ Church.

Maurice was its prophet and theologian whose influence continues today. But he was no Marxist, and with most Englishmen he was unsympathetic to revolution. But these leaders did see constructive forces at work in the revolutionary impulses. In assuming the name Christian socialism, they did not propose an economic doctrine nor a program of reform, but the &#8220;science of partnership.&#8221; They held that Christianity looked to a society in which people would work cooperatively together. Competition was held to be a denial of what the church believed. Maurice proposed cooperative workers&apos; unions and educational institutes. Maurice died in 1872, but his ideas continued to be influential. In June 1889, the Christian Social Union was formed to urge fundamental Christian social principles. Bishop B. F. Westcott was its first president, and its leaders included Henry Scott Holland and Bishop Charles Gore. In the twentieth century several successive Christian socialist groups were formed in the Church of England. In 1921 The Return of Christendom appeared, in which industrial capitalism was criticized in the light of catholic doctrine. In the United States, the American Church Socialist League and its successor, the Church League for Industrial Democracy, sought to further the Christian socialist agenda. The great figure of the twentieth century was William Temple (1881-1944), Archbishop of Canterbury, who urged that the church must choose between socialism and heresy. His Christianity and Social Order is a basic text for twentieth-century Christian socialism. The emphasis on theology and the gospel in Christian socialism rescues any effort to change social structures from simple expediency and avoids the separation of prayer and action.",

        "Christmas (in old English, Cristes maesse) is a festival celebrated on Dec. 25, commemorating the Incarnation of the Word of God in the birth of Jesus Christ. In the BCP it is also called The Nativity of Our Lord Jesus Christ. In the United States it is also a popular secular holiday. According to the Philocalian calendar, Christmas was first celebrated in Rome in the year 336. It gradually spread to the churches of the east, which already had a festival on Jan. 6 commemorating the manifestation of God in both the birth and baptism of Jesus. The date, Dec. 25, rests on no historical foundation. It was probably chosen to oppose the feast Natalis Solis Invicti, the birthday of the &quot;Unconquerable Sun God&quot; (Saturn), which took place at the winter solstice to celebrate the birth of &quot;the Sun of Righteousness.&quot; The customs associated with Christmas have developed from many sources. From early days the popular observance of Christmas was marked by the joy and celebration characteristic of the Roman Saturnalia and the pagan festivals which it replaced. It came to include the decoration of houses with greenery and the giving of gifts to children and the poor. In Britain other observances were added including the Yule log and Yule cakes, fir trees, gifts, and greetings. Fires and lights (symbols of warmth and lasting life) and evergreens (symbols of survival) were traditionally associated with both pagan and Christian festivals. Their use developed considerably in England with the importation of German customs and through the influence of the writings of Charles Dickens In the BCP, Christmas Day is one of the seven principal feasts. The Christmas season lasts twelve days, from Christmas Day until Jan. 5, the day before the Epiphany. The season includes Christmas Day, the First Sunday after Christmas Day, the Holy Name of Our Lord Jesus Christ, and may include the Second Sunday after Christmas Day. In many parishes, the main liturgical celebrations of Christmas take place on Christmas Eve.

After the Reformation, the English national church continued to be called the Church of England, but it repudiated the supremacy of the Pope. It retained, however, its ancient episcopal polity. By the 1534 Act of Supremacy, King Henry VIII became &#8220;Supreme Head of the Church of England,&#8221; and by the 1559 Act of Supremacy, Elizabeth I became &#8220;Supreme Governor of the Church of England,&#8221; supplanting the Pope. To this day the Church of England is episcopal in polity, with the sovereign, who still bears the Elizabethan title, as its legal administrative head. The Church of England is divided into the Province of Canterbury and the Province of York. The Archbishop of York is the Primate of England and Metropolitan, and the Archbishop of Canterbury is the Primate of all England and Metropolitan. The Province of Canterbury consists of thirty-one dioceses and the Province of York consists of fourteen dioceses.

Baptism is full initiation into the church, and all baptized persons are members of the church (BCP, pp. 299, 854). The church is the community of the New Covenant, the People of God, the New Israel, the Temple of the Holy Spirit, a holy nation, a royal priesthood, and the pillar and ground of truth (see BCP, p. 854). The church is described in the Nicene Creed as one, holy, catholic, and apostolic (see BCP, pp. 358-359). It is described as one because it is one body headed by Christ; holy because the Holy Spirit dwells in it, consecrating and guiding the members of the church; catholic because the church proclaims the whole Christian faith to all people, to the end of time; and apostolic because it continues in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, and it is sent to fulfill Christ&#039;s mission to all people (BCP, p. 854). We believe that Christ&#039;s presence is available in the life and sacraments of the church for our salvation, even though the church does not yet embody or represent Christ in a perfect way, and the four characteristics or &quot;marks&quot; of the church have not yet been perfectly realized. The fallibility of the church was recognized in Anglicanism by the Thirty-Nine Articles in the sixteenth century (see Articles XIX and XXI, BCP, pp. 871, 872). The Episcopal theologian William Porcher DuBose noted that Christ in the NT frequently means humanity in Christ or humanity in the church, as Adam in the NT frequently means humanity or the human race. Christ is the head of the church, and we are to share Christ&#039;s salvation in and through the church. We are to be one in Christ and one with each other in Christ through the church. The mission of the church is to restore all people to unity with God and each other. The church pursues its mission through prayer and worship, proclaiming the gospel, and promoting justice, peace, and love. The church completes its mission through the ministry of all its members (BCP, p. 855). The term &quot;church&quot; is from Greek words kyriakon, &quot;belonging to the Lord,&quot; and ekklesia, &quot;assembly.&quot; Church can also indicate a particular church body or denomination, such as the Episcopal Church; or a particular congregation or parish; or the building or place where a congregation gathers. The Hymnal 1982 provides sections of hymns for &quot;The Church&quot; (Hymns 517-527) and &quot;The Church&#039;s Mission&quot; (Hymns 528-544), including &quot;The Church&#039;s one foundation&quot; (Hymn 525), &quot;Let saints on earth in concert sing&quot; (Hymn 526), and &quot;Spread, O spread, thou mighty word&quot; (Hymn 530).",

He was consecrated at Trinity Church, New York City, on Sept. 17, 1792, by Samuel Provoost, Samuel Seabury, William White, and James Madison. Since Provoost, White, and Madison were consecrated in England, while Seabury was consecrated in Scotland, Claggett&apos;s consecration united both the English and Scottish episcopal lines of succession in the Episcopal Church. During his episcopate, Claggett also served as chaplain of the United States Senate and, later, as rector of Trinity Church, Upper Marlborough. He died in Croom, Maryland.",

In 202 he fled to Jerusalem because of the persecution of Emperor Severus. He was welcomed to Jerusalem by Bishop Alexander, a former student. Clement remained in Jerusalem until his death. The primary contribution of his writings was to combine Greek philosophy with the Christian faith, harmonizing faith and reason. Clement was one of the earliest Christian scholars, and a leading opponent of gnosticism. The Hymnal 1982 includes two of his hymn texts, &#8220;Sunset to sunrise changes now&#8221; (Hymn 163) and &#8220;Jesus, our mighty Lord&#8221; (Hymn 478).

The letter urges the Corinthian Church to restore the duly chosen leaders to their offices. He claims that the apostles had appointed the bishops and deacons. Neither they nor their successors were to be deprived of their offices. This is the seed of the theology of apostolic succession. However, Clement does not mention the single episcopate.

Since commissaries already performed functions for bishops in distant areas of dioceses in England, the Rt. Rev. Henry Compton, Bishop of London, decided in 1689 to appoint James Blair as the first American commissary. Blair served in Virginia for fifty-seven years. He established order over the church, enforced morality laws, and in 1693 founded the College of William and Mary, the first Anglican college in America. Blair&apos;s success demonstrated the usefulness of Compton&apos;s plan. Commissaries were soon designated for other colonies, including most notably Thomas Bray in Maryland. The system reached its peak of influence in the 1740s, when commissaries were active in nine of the thirteen colonies. However, the canonical powers of the commissary were limited, and the need for Anglican bishops resident in America gradually became apparent. As a result, the commissary system fell into disuse everywhere except in Virginia in the decade prior to the American Revolution. At least sixteen commissaries were sent to the American colonies.",

The number of members, their selection, and their terms of office are to be determined by diocesan canons. The functions of Commissions on Ministry specified in the canon are to assist the bishop &quot;in determining present and future needs for ministry in the diocese&quot; and to assist &quot;in enlisting and selecting persons for Holy Orders.&quot; Commissions are to develop, train, and affirm lay ministries. They interview candidates prior to their ordination as deacons and may interview candidates prior to their ordination as priests, if requested by the bishop, reporting to the bishop in each case. They assist the bishop in guiding and counseling deacons and other ministers, and they assist in matters pertaining to the continuing education of the clergy. The creation of Commissions on Ministry reflects the growing sense of the church that broad participation in decisions about all types of ministry is desirable and necessary. &nbsp;",

        "&nbsp; Joint celebration of the eucharist by a chief celebrant and one or more concelebrants. Concelebration may or may not include recitation of all or part of the eucharistic prayer by the concelebrants. In the early church, the bishop typically served as chief celebrant and was flanked by priests who joined in the celebration. The bishop alone spoke the eucharistic prayer, which did not have a fixed form. The concelebrants extended their hands over the oblations and prayed silently. This pattern of concelebration is described in the Apostolic Tradition of Hippolytus (c. 225). The practice of verbal concelebration developed in Rome in the seventh century. The necessity of verbal participation by the concelebrants has been a subject of dispute. Concelebration may express the unity of the church and the collegiality of the ordained ministries represented in the celebration of the eucharist. Concelebrants may wear matching or similar chasubles and stand in a semicircle with the chief celebrant in the center. At times, concelebrants have alternated in pronouncing sections of the eucharistic prayer. Concelebrants may extend their hands toward the bread and wine and may join the chief celebrant in reading the institution narrative and the invocation of the Holy Spirit. Concelebrants should share in the breaking of the bread at the fraction. The BCP notes that it is appropriate for other priests to stand with the celebrant at the altar, joining in the consecration of the gifts, breaking the bread, and distributing communion (p. 354). At the Ordination of a Bishop, the new bishop serves as chief celebrant while other bishops and presbyters serve as concelebrants (p. 522). At the Ordination of a Priest, the bishop serves as chief celebrant while the newly ordained priest and other presbyters serve as concelebrants (p. 535). The bishop also serves as chief celebrant at a Celebration of New Ministry, joined by the new priest and other priests of the diocese &quot;as an expression of the collegiality of the ministry in which they share&quot; (p. 558). &nbsp;",

The doctrine of concomitance affirms that the communicant receives Christ&apos;s body and blood in this situation.

        "The sacramental rite in which the candidates &quot;express a mature commitment to Christ, and receive strength from the Holy Spirit through prayer and the laying on of hands by a bishop&quot; (BCP, p. 860). Those who were baptized at an early age and those baptized as adults without laying on of hands by a bishop are expected to make a mature public affirmation of their faith, recommit themselves to the responsibilities of their baptism, and receive laying on of hands by a bishop (BCP, p. 412). Adults baptized with the laying on of hands by a bishop are considered to be confirmed. The Prayer Book rite for Confirmation includes forms for Reception and the Reaffirmation of Baptismal Vows. In some dioceses, those who have already made a mature Christian commitment in another denomination are recognized as members of the one holy catholic and apostolic church, and received into the fellowship of the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Communion. In other dioceses, those who have been sacramentally confirmed in the Roman Catholic or Orthodox churches are received and others are confirmed. Those who have returned from a time of religious inactivity to an active practice of faith may publicly reaffirm their baptismal vows. Others who have experienced a renewal of faith or desire to renew their Christian commitment may also reaffirm their baptismal vows. Reaffirmation may be repeated, depending on the pastoral needs of the person. Preparation for Confirmation/Reception/Reaffirmation should help the candidates discover the meaning of Christian commitment in their lives, and explore ways that their Christian commitment can be lived. This preparation may draw upon the baptismal covenant (BCP, pp. 416-417) and An Outline of the Faith (BCP, pp. 845-862). Confirmation, Reception, and Reaffirmation are rooted in the baptismal covenant. Confirmation/Reception/Reaffirmation may be done at the service of Holy Baptism or at the Easter Vigil when a bishop is present (BCP, pp. 292, 309-310). When there is no baptism, the entrance rite for Confirmation/Reception/Reaffirmation follows the entrance rite for baptism (BCP, p. 413). Candidates for Confirmation, Reception, and Reaffirmation are presented in separate groups by their presenters. Candidates may have individual presenters who will support them in their Christian life by prayer and example. It is not necessary that the presenters be members of the clergy. The candidates reaffirm their renunciation of evil, and renew their commitment to Jesus Christ. They reaffirm the promises made by them or for them at the time of baptism. Those present in the congregation promise to do all in their power to support the candidates in their life in Christ. The bishop leads the congregation in renewing the baptismal covenant. The Prayers for the Candidates from the baptismal liturgy may be used as the Prayers for the Candidates for Confirmation/Reception/Reaffirmation (BCP, p. 417). The bishop lays hands on each candidate for Confirmation. The BCP provides specific prayers to be said by the bishop for Confirmation, for Reception, and for Reaffirmation. The bishop may shake hands with those who are being received to welcome them into this communion, and the bishop may lay hands on them in blessing. The bishop may also bless those who reaffirm their baptismal vows. The Episcopal Church&#039;s theology of Confirmation has continued to evolve along with its understanding of baptism. Confirmation is no longer seen as the completion of Christian initiation, nor is Confirmation a prerequisite for receiving communion. Baptism is full initiation by water and the Holy Spirit into Christ&#039;s body the church (BCP, p. 298). Accordingly, Confirmation has been increasingly understood in terms of a mature, public reaffirmation of the Christian faith and the baptismal promises. Some dioceses require that candidates for Confirmation be at least sixteen years old to insure that the candidates are making a mature and independent affirmation of their faith. There is considerable diversity of understanding and practice concerning Confirmation in the Episcopal Church. Confirmation has been characterized as &quot;a rite seeking a theology.&quot; When Confirmation/Reception/Reaffirmation is celebrated on Sunday or a major feast, the propers (collect and readings) for that day are used. The BCP also provides special propers for Confirmation at other times. &nbsp;",

        "A form of mental prayer in which meditation and petition give way to quiet adoration of the mysteries of God. Contemplation is the fruit of divine grace. It comes after a period of recollection and self-abandonment. Daily concerns vanish and exclusive attention is given to the mysteries of the Trinity, the Incarnation, and Redemption. Active imagination gives way to waiting and listening. God is sought and found within the self as divine dwelling-place. The contemplative way may lead through phases of spiritual dryness, often called &#8220;nights.&#8221; Its summit is conscious participation in the very life of God, metaphorically called the state of &#8220;spiritual marriage.&#8221; Forms of contemplation are found in all great religions. It is described in the Upanishads and by the sûfîs of Islam. The experience of contemplation does not guarantee the orthodoxy of its expression. Yet the great Christian contemplatives remain within the parameters of faith as their experience rests upon the mediation of Christ and is nurtured by the gifts of the Spirit. While contemplation is not experienced by all believers, it may be desired by all, and such a desire is already God&apos;s grace.",

The story of the conversion and baptism of Cornelius and his household is recorded in Acts 10:1-11:18. Their conversion and baptism served as a precedent in resolving the question whether a Gentile must first become a Jew to become a Christian. Cornelius, &#8220;a devout man who feared God,&#8221; was commanded in a vision by an angel to send for Peter at Joppa. Before those sent by Cornelius arrived, Peter was told while in a trance, &#8220;What God has made clean, you must not call profane.&#8221; Peter subsequently visited Cornelius&apos;s home, and proclaimed the Christian faith to them. While Peter was speaking, the Holy Spirit came down on Cornelius and his household. They spoke in tongues. This event was like the gift of the Holy Spirit to the apostles at Pentecost. Peter directed that Cornelius and his household should be baptized. Circumcision was not required by Peter for baptism. Peter was criticized by the Judaistic Christian church in Jerusalem for visiting the uncircumcised and eating with them. He defended himself by recalling the story of the baptism of Cornelius and his household. He noted that &#8220;God gave them the same gift that he gave us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ.&#8221; This silenced Peter&apos;s critics, who praised God and proclaimed that &#8220;God has given even to the Gentiles the repentance that leads to life.&#8221; This issue was later resolved more fully by an apostolic council in Jerusalem which determined that &#8220;we should not trouble those Gentiles who are turning to God&#8221; (Acts 15).

        "&nbsp;<div>\n\tThis feast commemorates the institution of the eucharist by Jesus on the night of his betrayal and arrest. It is often associated with a festive procession that follows the celebration of the eucharist. A consecrated host in a monstrance is prominently displayed in this procession. It is treated as the triumphant Christ the King. This feast is observed in the Roman Catholic Church on the Thursday after Trinity Sunday. Emphasis on Jesus&#039; Passion in the Maundy Thursday service led to selection of another day for celebration of the Feast of Corpus Christi, even though the eucharist was instituted by Jesus on the Thursday before his death. The Feast of Corpus Christi is not included in the feasts of our Lord or other feasts of the Episcopal calendar of the church year. However, it is celebrated by some Episcopal parishes, especially those with an Anglo-catholic piety.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\tThe BCP provides a proper collect and readings for the celebration &quot;Of the Holy Eucharist&quot; among the &quot;Various Occasions&quot; for optional use. This service is a commemoration of the institution of the eucharist. It may be celebrated at any time, subject to the rules set forth in the calendar of the church year. A Prayer Book rubric notes that this celebration is especially suitable for Thursdays. The collect for this celebration is a revised version of the collect composed by St. Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225-1274) for the Feast of Corpus Christi (BCP, p. 252). The BCP provides another version of this prayer for use &quot;After Receiving Communion&quot; (p. 834).</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\tObservance of this feast dates from the thirteenth century. The nun Juliana of Li&egrave;ge (d. 1258), in Belgium, became an advocate for such a feast in response to a vision. The first Feast of Corpus Christi was celebrated at Li&egrave;ge around 1247. Its observance by the western church was commanded by Pope Urban IV in 1264.</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\tA procession of the host has been a prominent part of the celebration since the fourteenth century. Historically, in medieval times, cycles of mystery plays were performed around the time of the Feast of Corpus Christi in France, Germany, and England. These plays dramatized salvation history with stories from the OT and NT.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\tAnglican and Episcopal ambivalence about the Feast of Corpus Christi is likely related to its historic association with the Roman Catholic dogma of transubstantiation. Urban IV commissioned Aquinas to compose the special Mass and offices for the feast. Aquinas also composed hymns for this celebration. Aquinas&#039;s hymn, &quot;Lauda Sion,&quot; was originally composed as the sequence hymn for the eucharist on the Feast of Corpus Christi. The &quot;Tantum ergo&quot; was originally Aquinas&#039;s hymn for vespers on the Feast of Corpus Christi. The Hymnal 1982 includes both the &quot;Lauda Sion&quot; (Hymn 320) and the &quot;Tantum ergo&quot; (Hymn 330; Hymns 329/331, stanzas 5-6), but with Aquinas&#039;s original references to transubstantiation omitted.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n",

A covenant also typically includes terms, oaths, and a ritual enactment (possibly a sacrifice, a meal, an exchange, or even a handshake). A covenant with God is a relationship initiated by God for salvation and responded to in faith. The old covenant was given by God to the Hebrew people. The story of this covenant is revealed in the OT (see BCP, pp. 846-847). It was by covenant that the Hebrew people entered into special relationship with God and became the people of God.The OT tells many stories of God&#8217;s covenant with the people of Israel. God made a covenant with Noah and his descendants that there will never again be a flood to destroy the earth. Noah serves as mediator of this covenant between God and all that lives on the earth. God&#8217;s bow in the clouds was the sign of this covenant (Gn 9: 8-17). God also made a covenant with Abraham, in which God promised Abraham that his posterity would be as numerous as the stars and that Abraham&#8217;s descendants would have the promised land (Gn 15: 1-21). God made a covenant with Moses that the people of Israel would be God&#8217;s people, and God would be their God. God also promised to free them from the burdens of the Egyptians and to bring them to the land that God covenanted to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (Ex 6: 2-8). God&#8217;s covenant with Moses and the people of Israel was to be lived out by them in terms of the Ten Commandments (see Ex 20: 1-17, Ex 34, Dt 5: 6-21).The new covenant is the new relationship with God given by Jesus to the apostles and through them to all who believe in Jesus (see BCP, pp. 850-851). At the Last Supper, Jesus shared the cup of wine with the apostles, saying, &#8220;This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood&#8221; (Lk 22:20). We share in the new covenant as participants in Christ&#8217;s life, death, and resurrection. Jesus&#8217; Summary of the Law was that we are to love God with all our heart, soul, and mind; and we are to love our neighbor as we love ourselves (Mt 22:37-40; see BCP, p. 851). We live out our participation in the new covenant in terms of the new commandment that we love one another as Christ loved us (Jn 13: 34-35; see BCP, p. 851). The new covenant is a life of love that we share with Christ and with each other in Christ&#8217;s name. Christian initiation takes place in terms of the baptismal covenant (BCP, pp. 304-305), which is renewed at Confirmation (BCP, pp. 416-417).",

Cranmer received his B.A. from Jesus College, Cambridge University, in 1511. In 1520 he was ordained priest and selected as one of the university preachers. Around 1521 he began to be influenced by Lutheran ideas and became antipapal. When King Henry VIII was seeking the annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, Cranmer suggested that the king refer the issue to the professors at the universities. Henry was impressed with this idea. In 1531 Cranmer was named ambassador to the imperial court of Charles V with the task of making contact with the German Lutherans and getting their support for the annulment. While in Germany he met the Lutheran theologian Andreas Osiander and married Osiander&apos;s niece, Margaret. Henry named Cranmer Archbishop of Canterbury, and Pope Clement VII consented. Cranmer was consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury on Mar. 30, 1533. One of Cranmer&apos;s first official acts came on May 25, 1533, when he formally stated that Henry&apos;s marriage to Catherine was null and void. As archbishop he was the author of the first Anglican Prayer Book (1549). He was the leader in moderate doctrinal reform as expressed in the Ten Articles of 1536 and the Bishops&apos; Book of 1537. Under King Edward VI (1547-1553), he continued as a leader of the Reformation. With the accession of Queen Mary in 1553, Cranmer&apos;s Protestant policies fell into disfavor. On Nov. 13, 1553, he was deprived of his office as archbishop. In 1556 he was accused of high treason and handed over to the state for execution. He recanted, but the prospect of death restored both his faith and his dignity. He renounced his recantation and reaffirmed his opposition to papal power and the doctrine of transubstantiation. At the stake he steadfastly held his right hand in the fire until it was consumed. He did this because his right hand &#8220;had offended&#8221; by signing the recantation. The BCP of 1549, revised in 1552, stands as the greatest achievement of his genius.

Crapsey was a colleague of Social Gospel theologian Walter Rauschenbusch. In 1905 Crapsey published a series of lectures entitled Religion and Politics. In this book he advocated that the church become involved in social reform. He also argued for the reinterpretation of traditional doctrines such as the Trinity and the Virgin Birth. Crapsey was tried for heresy. He was convicted and deposed by William Walker, Bishop of Western New York, on Dec. 4, 1906. Crapsey continued to write and lecture on his religious ideas for the next two decades. He died in Rochester, New York.",

        "Creationism",
        "1) Understanding that God creates and directly infuses a new soul in every person at conception. The soul is understood to be created by God out of nothing. Creationism denies the pre-existence of the soul (Pre-existentialism), and it denies that the soul is transmitted by the parents or generated with the body (Traducianism). 2) Understanding that God created the universe out of nothing by a free act of will. Creationism denies that creation is identical with God, or an emanation from God, or an illusion. 3) Creationism also refers to an understanding that God created the universe without employing an evolutionary process. Many creationists believe that biblical faith is contradicted by scientific theories of evolution. This understanding is associated with a literal reading of the Book of Genesis. On the other hand, many Christian theologians, including William Porcher DuBose of the Episcopal Church, understand evolutionary theory to be compatible with God&apos;s continuous process of saving activity in the world.

        "The reducing by fire of a dead body to ashes. The ashes may be placed in an urn or other container and interred in a niche of a columbarium. The ashes may also be buried or scattered in a memorial garden on church grounds or in a cemetery. The ashes may be referred to as &#8220;cremains.&#8221; The early Christians considered cremation inappropriate because the body was to be resurrected. Early Christians followed the Jewish practice of burial. Cremation largely ceased in the Roman empire by the fifth century. However, several cremation societies were organized in Europe during the nineteenth century. Cremation was urged by some because of concern for public hygiene and conservation of land. The practice became more widespread, and was no longer understood to deny the resurrection of the body. The 1979 BCP is the first American Prayer Book to recognize cremation. The BCP states (p. 490) that the committal service may precede cremation. The legitimacy of cremation in the Church of England is recognized by the 1969 Canons which state that the ashes of a cremated person should be interred or deposited in consecrated ground. The Roman Catholic Church resisted the practice of cremation in the nineteenth century because it was associated with anti-Catholic sentiments and materialism. The Roman Catholic penalties for cremation were withdrawn by a decree of the Holy Office (July 5, 1963), unless there is evidence of bad faith. See Columbarium.",

        "Cross",
        "The instrument of Jesus&#039; death and the central symbol of the Christian faith. It represents Jesus&#039; offering and sacrifice of his life in love for us and our salvation. The cross thus symbolizes the Christian life, especially in terms of love, generosity, and sacrifice. The cross itself was a vertical stake in the ground which often had a horizontal piece attached at the top or just below the top of the vertical piece. Death on a cross was both execution and extreme torture. The victim to be executed on the cross would be attached to it until death. At times an inscription would be attached to the cross to state the victim&#039;s crime. Crucifixion was a shameful death that carried with it a considerable stigma in Jesus&#039; day. Jesus&#039; death on a cross is described in the NT gospels (Mt 27, Mk 15, Lk 23, Jn 19). The cross has been the traditional focus of Christian piety. The practice of making the sign of the cross on the forehead dates from the second century. Devotion to the cross was spurred by the alleged finding of the true cross of Jesus&#039; crucifixion in the fourth century. Use of altar crosses dates from the fifth century, and use of processional crosses dates from the sixth century. During the middle ages, large crosses, or roods, were placed on beams at the dividing point between the chancel and nave of the church. Designs for crosses became very ornate, and some crosses were decorated with jewels. Crosses are used in Christian art and architecture, and worn as an expression of personal piety. Crosses are found in a variety of shapes and sizes. A crucifix is a cross with a figure of the crucified Christ. A Christus Rex is a cross with a figure of the risen Christ in glory. A Jerusalem cross is a cross with four small crosses in between the arms of the larger cross. The Prayer Book Good Friday service allows a wooden cross to be brought into the church after the solemn collects. The cross is placed in the sight of the people, and appropriate devotions may follow (BCP, pp. 281-282). Hymns in The Hymnal 1982 that express devotion to the cross include &quot;When I survey the wondrous cross&quot; (474), &quot;In the cross of Christ I glory&quot; (441-442), and &quot;Lift high the cross&quot; (473).",

        "Use of daily prayers to mark the times of the day and to express the traditions of the praying community is traditional in Judaism and in Christianity. The third, sixth, and ninth hours (9 a.m., 12 noon, and 3 p.m.) were times of private prayer in Judaism. The congregational or cathedral form of office developed in Christianity under Constantine (274 or 288-337) with the principal morning and evening services of lauds and vespers. The people participated in the cathedral form of office. The monastic form of office also developed at this time. In addition to lauds and vespers, the monastic form included matins (at midnight or cockcrow), prime (the first hour), terce (the third hour), sext (the sixth hour), none (the ninth hour), and compline (at bedtime). By the late middle ages, the Daily Office was seen as the responsibility of the monks and clergy rather than an occasion for participation by all in the prayers of the community throughout the day.After the Anglican Reformation, Archbishop Thomas Cranmer (1489-1556) reduced the eight monastic offices to the two services of Morning and Evening Prayer. These services were printed in vernacular English and intended for use by all members of the church. Participation in the Daily Office is at the heart of Anglican spirituality. It is the proper form of daily public worship in the church. In addition to forms for Daily Morning Prayer and Daily Evening Prayer in contemporary and traditional language, the BCP section for the Daily Office includes forms for Noonday Prayer, Order of Worship for the Evening, Compline, and Daily Devotions for Individuals and Families. These offices include prayers, a selection from the Psalter, readings from the Holy Scriptures, one or more canticles, and the Lord&apos;s Prayer. Forms for Morning and Evening Prayer include an optional confession of sin. The BCP provides a Daily Office Lectionary that identifies readings and psalm choices for Morning and Evening Prayer (pp. 936-1001), and a Table of Canticles with suggested canticles for use at Morning Prayer and Evening Prayer (pp. 144-145).

        "The distinctive vestment of deacons in the western church. It may be worn at any liturgy in any season. The term is derived from a white tunic worn in second-century Dalmatia. The dalmatic was an ample white tunic with wide sleeves, bands about the cuffs, and clavi, or colored bands, descending from the shoulders to the hem. Historically, it was worn over an alb by both bishops and deacons by the fourth century, but it did not become a vestment until around the ninth century. The dalmatic was accepted as the vestment worn by the deacon at the eucharist by the ninth century. Eventually deacons adopted the eastern orarion or stole, worn on top and hanging straight down from the left shoulder. Over the centuries the dalmatic, like other vestments, lost its full shape. The stole disappeared beneath the outer garment. By the late middle ages, deacons (or, more commonly, priests acting as liturgical deacons) were wearing a short dalmatic in the color of the day, ornate in fabric, adorned with orphreys (two vertical and two horizontal), with narrow sleeves, and open at the sides. The dalmatic has varied widely in appearance, and this variety continues in the Episcopal Church today. In many places the medieval dalmatic has given way to a full-length white or off-white tunic which is simple and functional. It is worn sometimes over an alb, sometimes by itself (as a combination cassock-alb-dalmatic). Deacons often wear the stole on top, placed over the left shoulder and tied under the right arm or hanging straight down.",

In the Episcopal Church a deacon exercises &#8220;a special ministry of servanthood&#8221; directly under the deacon&apos;s bishop, serving all people and especially those in need (BCP, p. 543). This definition reflects the practice of the early church, in which deacons were ordained &#8220;not to the priesthood but to the servanthood [diakonia, &#8220;ministry&#8221;] of the bishop&#8221; (Hippolytus, Apostolic Tradition). In the ancient Greek-speaking world the term diakonos meant an intermediary who acted or spoke for a superior. Christian deacons were agents of the bishop, often with oversight of charity. Since ancient times the liturgical functions of deacons have suggested the activity of angels. As they proclaim the gospel, lead intercessions, wait at the eucharistic table, and direct the order of the assembly, deacons act as sacred messengers, agents, and attendants. The revival of the order of deacons in the twentieth century has emphasized social care and service. Many bishops in the Episcopal Church expect their deacons to promote care of the needy outside the church. In addition to those ordained deacon as a permanent vocation, there are also &#8220;transitional deacons&#8221; who are ordained deacon as a preliminary step toward ordination as a priest. This practice is required by the canons of the Episcopal Church, but its theology and usefulness has been questioned by those who favor direct ordination to the order for which one is chosen.

Their work included instructing in the faith, preparing candidates for baptism and confirmation, caring for women and children, and organizing and carrying on social work. There were training schools for deaconesses in New York and Philadelphia.

In 1970 women were allowed to be ordained as deacons. All deaconesses were automatically assumed into the diaconate, although a few refused to be called deacons.",

After he was ordained deacon and priest, he began a systematic and life-long study of liturgics and liturgical ceremonial. In 1899 he published The Parson&apos;s Handbook, in which he demonstrated that it is possible to be a ritualist without being a Romanist. He put his ideas into practice as vicar of St. Mary&apos;s Church, Primrose Hill, Hampstead, 1901-1915. From 1919 until 1936, he was professor of ecclesiastical arts at King&apos;s College, London. In 1931 he became a Canon of Westminster Cathedral. Dearmer was a co-editor of the English Hymnal (1906), Songs of Praise (1925), and the Oxford Book of Carols (1928). In the 1920s, he published a five-volume work, Lessons on the Way. It was to form the basis for a course of lay education which would take five years to complete.

        "The BCP provides a form for the Dedication and Consecration of a Church (pp. 567-574). The bishop presides at this service. The church may be consecrated at any time after it is ready for regular use as a place of worship. The building does not have to be debt-free or owned (see BCP, p. 575). All participants typically assemble near the church before the service begins. They process to the main door of the church after prayers by the bishop. Sacred vessels, ornaments, and decorations may be carried into the building in the procession. Blueprints, keys, and tools used in building the church may also be carried in procession (BCP, p. 575). The bishop uses the pastoral staff to mark the threshold with the sign of the cross. Sections of the prayer for the consecration of the church are said by the bishop, by a warden or other representative of the congregation, and by the rector or minister in charge. The bishop then dedicates the font, the lectern, and (or) the pulpit. After the liturgy of the word, with sermon or address, other pastoral offices (possibly including Blessing of Oil for the Sick or Commitment to Christian Service), the Nicene Creed, and the prayers of the people, the bishop consecrates the altar. After the altar is consecrated, bells may be rung. Members of the congregation vest the altar, place the vessels on it, and light the candles (BCP, p. 574). The service continues with the eucharist. Appropriate portions of this form may be used or adapted to dedicate parts of a building or furnishings that have been added or renovated, or to dedicate a chapel or oratory in another building. The consecration of a church building was traditionally associated with its first use. This connection was broken by a canon enacted in 1868. It required the building and its ground to be fully paid for and free of debt or legal encumbrances when consecrated. The 1979 BCP once again connects first use of the church building and consecration. As a practical reality, depending on the bishop&#039;s schedule, the service of consecration may not be the very first service in the new building. The BCP provides an order of service for use when a church or chapel has long been used for worship without formal consecration by a bishop. This form provides an opportunity for the congregation to reaffirm its commitment to mission and ministry. This order is especially appropriate on occasions such as recognition of the congregation as an independent parish, a major anniversary, or paying off a debt. It recognizes that the church building has already been consecrated by prayerful use.",

        "Deism",
        "A teaching about God which appeared in both Christian and non-Christian forms during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in England and France, under the influence of rationalism and the rise of natural science. Lord Herbert of Cherbury (1580-1630) introduced deist thought to England. It was developed by Matthew Tindal (1653-1733) and John Toland (1670-1722), among others. The title of Toland&#039;s book, Christianity Not Mysterious, expresses the tone of this body of thought. Deists used the cosmological argument to prove the existence of God, who created the universe and governed it through natural law. Natural laws were discoverable by reason, according to this &quot;natural religion.&quot; Teachers, among whom Jesus was regarded as definitive, taught humans the divinely inspired moral law to keep their behavior in harmony with the divine plan. People were to be moved to obey the moral law by the expectation of future rewards and punishments. Some Deists viewed God as an original architect and initial mover of creation. Deism denied that God exercises providential care for humanity or the universe. It believed in a &quot;divine clock-maker&quot; who merely set the universe in motion. Deism also denied our need of special revelation, holding that human reason alone leads to the principles of natural reason and morality. Matthew Tindal, whose Christianity as Old as the Creation (1730) became known as the &quot;Bible&quot; of Deism, held that the gospel added nothing to the law of nature, that true religion was a &quot;republication&quot; of the law, and that God&#039;s design was to free humanity from superstition. A number of eighteenth-century Anglican theologians endeavored to show that Christianity did not contradict natural religion (Joseph Butler&#039;s Analogy of Religion), or that it could be understood in deistic terms (William Paley&#039;s Natural Religion). Deistic works were produced in America by Ethan Allen and Thomas Paine. The mechanical, astronomical model of the universe which informed deistic thought remained theologically influential until supplanted by biological models in the nineteenth century.

DeKoven was the most widely known and respected leader of the Anglo-catholic movement of the nineteenth century. DeKoven was known as the &#8220;American Keble.&#8221; He was influenced by the Oxford Movement (Tractarians) and brought many of their principles, especially the doctrine of the Real Presence in the Holy Eucharist, to the attention of the Episcopal Church. DeKoven was also a ritualist, and under his leadership, the choir at Racine College was vested. He allowed lights (candles) on the altar of St. John&apos;s Chapel. At the General Conventions of 1871 and 1874 he defended eucharistic adoration and pleaded for comprehensiveness in doctrine and worship. His addresses to General Convention on these occasions are considered to be some of the most significant moments of oratory in the history of General Convention. A stringent canon on ritual was avoided through DeKoven&apos;s advocacy. But his defense of ritualism caused many in the Episcopal Church of his day to be suspicious of him. He was nominated Bishop of Massachusetts in 1872 and of Milwaukee in 1874. He was elected but not consecrated Bishop of Illinois in 1875 because he did not receive the necessary consents from a sufficient number of diocesan standing committees in the Episcopal Church. He was never made a bishop. DeKoven died in Racine. His shrine is on the grounds of the DeKoven Center, Racine, Wisconsin.

Before the church adopted the word it had a long secular usage. It was originally used in the Roman Empire for an administrative subdivision. A diocese was a division of a prefecture of the Roman Empire. In the reorganization of Diocletian and Constantine, the Roman Empire was divided into twelve dioceses. As the church expanded out from the cities, it adopted the use of the word &#8220;diocese,&#8221; and ecclesiastical dioceses tended to correspond to civil units. For example, at first the Diocese of Georgia corresponded with the State of Georgia. Later, many statewide dioceses were divided into smaller dioceses for pastoral and practical reasons. For example, the State of New York includes six dioceses. In more recent years, some dioceses have been formed from portions of more than one state. The Diocese of the Rio Grande includes all of New Mexico and part of west Texas, and the Diocese of the Central Gulf Coast includes portions of southern Alabama and western Florida. In England, the diocese is the territory of the bishop and the parish is a subdivision of it. Every diocese in the Episcopal Church has a Standing Committee. When there is a bishop in charge of the diocese, the Standing Committee is the bishop&apos;s council of advice. When there is no bishop, bishop coadjutor or suffragan bishop, the Standing Committee is the ecclesiastical authority of the diocese. A diocese usually meets annually in a diocesan convention. Each diocese is entitled to representation in the House of Deputies by not more than four ordained persons, presbyters or deacons, canonically resident in the diocese, and not more than four lay persons, who are confirmed adult communicants of the Episcopal Church and in good standing in the diocese. Dioceses also elect clerical and lay deputies to the Provincial Synod. The Constitution and Canons of the Episcopal Church provide guidelines for the division of a diocese.

One was expected to pass through a sequence of orders to get experience in leadership and ministry. By the late middle ages, under the influence of Augustine&apos;s teaching about the Donatist heresy, orders were considered indelible and therefore cumulative. One was understood to remain in a &#8220;lower&#8221; order even after being ordained to a &#8220;higher&#8221; order.

At Antioch the disciples were first called Christians (Acts 11:26). The term &#8220;Christian&#8221; came to be the usual term for a Christian believer. The term &#8220;disciple&#8221; does not appear in the epistles. However, the concept of discipleship (being a Christian disciple) continues to be an important part of the Christian life. For example, Dietrich Bonhoeffer (1906-1945) considered discipleship in Die Nachfolge, or The Cost of Discipleship (1937, trans. by Reginald H. Fuller, 1948).

Catechumens in the early church were dismissed from the Sunday service before the prayers of the faithful, the peace, and eucharistic sharing. Some have noted parallels of the Disciplina Arcani to the secrecy of mystery religions. But the main reasons for the Disciplina Arcani were to protect the church during times of active persecution or marginal toleration, and a catechetical approach that emphasized experiencing the initiatory sacraments (including baptism, anointing, laying on of hands, and first communion) before learning about them. After the sixth century the need for secrecy had passed, but there was continuing catechetical emphasis on experience and participation.

In 1216 Pope Honorius III granted Dominic the right to establish a new religious order. This new order was to preach the gospel, convert heretics, defend the faith, and propagate Christianity. It was named the Order of Friars Preachers (OP). Members of the order are sometimes called Dominicans, in honor of their founder. In England the members of the order are sometimes called Black Friars because of the black mantle or cappa which they wore over their white habits and scapulars. The first Dominican monastery was established at Toulouse. The order followed the rule of St. Augustine, and was known for a while as the &#8220;regular canons of St. Augustine.&#8221; The Dominicans were dedicated to refuting heresy by intellectual argument and the example of a holy life. They frequently founded their houses in university cities. The greatest Dominican teacher is St. Thomas Aquinas. Dominic was canonized by Pope Gregory IX on July 13, 1234. Dominic died in Bologna. He is commemorated in the Episcopal calendar of the church year on Aug. 8. See Aquinas, Thomas.",

        "Rigorist schism. Donatists were the followers of Donatus Magnus, a schismatic bishop of Carthage in the mid-fourth century, who believed that the validity of a sacrament depended on the personal virtue of the celebrant. Many other North African Christians shared this view. In particular this group of rigorists rejected the ordination of Caecilian as Bishop of Carthage by a neighboring bishop, who was falsely believed to have betrayed the church during the Diocletian persecutions earlier in the fourth century. Caecilian was excommunicated and Majorinus ordained in his stead. Caecilian was confirmed in his position by the Council of Arles in 314, but a flourishing schismatic church sprang up around Majorinus and his able and aggressive successor, Donatus. Imperial force was used for several decades to suppress the schism, and was met with widespread violent resistance. The Donatist sect survived for several centuries. Augustine engaged in a celebrated and extensive controversy with the Donatists. He established the catholic teaching that the validity of sacramental action depends upon the power of the Holy Spirit in the church, and not the personal character of the celebrant. Augustine argued that the catholic church is a mixed society in the process of salvation rather than a perfect society in itself. This view is shared by the Articles of Religion (Art. XXVI, BCP, p. 873).",

He graduated from The Citadel in 1855, and received his M.A. from the University of Virginia in 1859. His study for the ordained ministry at the Theological Seminary of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Diocese of South Carolina at Camden was interrupted in 1861 by the Civil War. DuBose served as an adjutant in the Confederate Army. He was wounded in action and taken as a prisoner of war. After his release, he was ordained deacon on Dec. 13, 1863. He began his ministry as a chaplain to Confederate soldiers. After the war, he was rector of St. John&apos;s Church, Fairfield, South Carolina. He was ordained priest on Sept. 9, 1866. DuBose served as rector of Trinity Church, Abbeville, from 1868 until 1871. He was chaplain at the University of the South, Sewanee, Tennessee, from July 17, 1871, until June 30, 1883. He helped to establish the School of Theology at the University of the South. DuBose taught in both the College of Arts and Sciences and the School of Theology. He was the second dean of the School of Theology from July 31, 1894, until June 24, 1901. DuBose is recognized as a major theologian in the history of the Episcopal Church. He published seven books, the first of which was The Soteriology of the New Testament (1892), which presented his systematic approach to theology. He then applied this theological system to the history of the early church in The Ecumenical Councils (1896), and to the NT. DuBose worked out his theological system relative to the synoptic gospels in The Gospel in the Gospels (1906), the Pauline literature in The Gospel According to Saint Paul (1907), the Letter to the Hebrews in High Priesthood and Sacrifice (1908), and the Johannine writings in The Reason of Life (1911). DuBose&apos;s theology was deeply rooted in the lessons of his experience. He discussed his experience and theology in his autobiographical Turning Points in My Life (1912). In this book he described a powerful experience of conversion he had while he was a cadet at The Citadel. This experience was formative for the rest of his life and ministry. DuBose came to understand salvation in terms of a continuing process by which the objective truth of God&apos;s grace may become increasingly a subjective reality for the believer. DuBose&apos;s experiences of loss, poverty, and suffering-during the Civil War and afterwards-were formative for his understanding of the role of the cross in the life of Christ and in the Christian life. DuBose&apos;s experiences of discovery in education as a teacher and student were formative for his understanding of the needed openness of the church. He was ecumenical in outlook and wary of the claims of ultimate truth held by any faction of the church in isolation. He believed in the working out of extremes and the unmasking of errors through open discussion. He was a frequent contributor to the ecumenical journal The Constructive Quarterly. DuBose believed in the continuity of church tradition, but he also believed that the truth must be discovered anew in each time and situation. He died in Sewanee.

Christians in England applied the word to the principal festival of the church year, both day and season. 1) Easter Day is the annual feast of the resurrection, the pascha or Christian Passover, and the eighth day of cosmic creation. Faith in Jesus&apos; resurrection on the Sunday or third day following his crucifixion is at the heart of Christian belief. Easter sets the experience of springtime next to the ancient stories of deliverance and the proclamation of the risen Christ. In the west, Easter occurs on the first Sunday after the full moon on or after the vernal equinox. Easter always falls between Mar. 22 and Apr. 25 inclusive. Following Jewish custom, the feast begins at sunset on Easter Eve with the Great Vigil of Easter. The Eastern Orthodox Church celebrates Easter on the first Sunday after the Jewish pesach or Passover (which follows the spring full moon). Although the two dates sometimes coincide, the eastern date is often one or more weeks later. 2) Easter Season. See Great Fifty Days.",

Through this liturgy, the BCP recovers an ancient practice of keeping the Easter feast. Believers would gather in the hours of darkness ending at dawn on Easter to hear scripture and offer prayer. This night-long service of prayerful watching anticipated the baptisms that would come at first light and the Easter Eucharist. Easter was the primary baptismal occasion for the early church to the practical exclusion of all others.

The church is described in the creeds as one, holy, catholic, and apostolic. The mission of the church is to restore all people to unity with God and each other in Christ. The church carries out its mission through the ministry of all its members, including lay persons, bishops, priests, and deacons. A doctrine of ministry is usually included in ecclesiology.

Using the new idea of continuing education for professionals, Howe founded the Institute for Advanced Pastoral Studies in 1957, located at Cranbrook House in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. The institute was the first ecumenical facility for the continuing education of clergy in the United States. In 1973 the Rev. John Biersdorf succeeded Howe as director of the institute. Biersdorf stressed the life of prayer as the basis and foundation for ministry. The institute focused on the integration of social action with the life of prayer. The institute&apos;s mission was expressed in the motto, &#8220;Inner Growth and Outer Change.&#8221; In 1978 a pilot project was begun for developing a Doctor of Ministry program. It was decided that instead of building a new school, they would initiate cooperation among the resources already existing in the area. This resulted in the establishment in 1980 of the Ecumenical Theological Center. The institute and the center relocated to the Convent at St. Bede&apos;s Roman Catholic Church in Southfield, Michigan. Following another relocation to the Marygrove College campus in Detroit, the institute and the center merged into a new organization in 1986, also called the Ecumenical Theological Center.

The number eight has been associated with resurrection, the eschatological fulfillment of time, new life, redemption, and baptism. Octagonal baptisteries and fonts reflect this symbolism of the number eight, and faith that in baptism we share the new life of Christ&apos;s resurrection and rebirth by the Holy Spirit.

He became a British citizen. He worked and wrote in London most of his life. After being raised in the Unitarian tradition and going through a time of agnosticism, Eliot was baptized in the parish church at Finstock, Oxfordshire, in 1927. He subsequently declared his perspective in religion to be Anglo-catholic. His poetry reflected his intense faith, as his poem The Waste Land (1922) and The Hollow Men (1925) had expressed his earlier experience of meaninglessness. His religious poems include Journey of the Magi (1927) and Ash Wednesday (1930). Eliot was responsible to a large extent for the revival of interest in the so-called metaphysical poets, several of whom were Anglican priests, including John Donne, George Herbert, and Thomas Traherne. He also used Little Gidding, the religious house founded by Nicholas Ferrar, as the inspiration and title of one of his Four Quartets (1935-1942). Eliot wrote the play Murder in the Cathedral (1935), which deals with the martyrdom of Archbishop Thomas Becket in Canterbury Cathedral.

        "Elizabethan Settlement",
        "Religious and political arrangements worked out during the reign of Elizabeth I in England. Elizabeth I (1533-1603), daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, became Queen of England in 1558. Religious differences threatened the stability of England at that time. England had been officially Protestant under the rule of Edward VI from 1547 to 1553 and Roman Catholic under the rule of Mary Tudor from 1553 to 1558. Elizabeth&#039;s subjects included both Catholics and Calvinists. Elizabeth faced the religious question squarely at the beginning of her reign. The year 1559 was crucial for the future of Anglicanism. The Elizabethan settlement sought to be an inclusive middle course between divergent religious positions in English Christianity. Much of traditional Catholic faith and practice was retained, but without submission to papal authority. Much latitude for individual conscience was allowed, but uniformity of worship was required. Faithful Christians with differing theological convictions could find a home in a comprehensive English church. The Act of Supremacy of 1559 proclaimed Elizabeth to be the &quot;supreme governor of this realm&quot; in all spiritual, ecclesiastical, and temporal matters. Elizabeth&#039;s assertion of power over the English church was not as sweeping as that of Henry VIII, who was proclaimed the only supreme head on earth of the English church. The Act of Supremacy of 1559 included an oath of obedience to the Crown that was imposed on all clergy and public officials. Elizabeth exercised royal power concerning the church within the provisions of religious legislation, and she protected the church from attempts by Parliament to meddle. An amended version of the 1552 Prayer Book was reissued under the Act of Uniformity of 1559. The revised Prayer Book included the Ornaments Rubric, which was inserted before the services of Morning and Evening Prayer. It declared that the ornaments of churches and clergy should be those in use in the second year of the reign of Edward VI, a time when traditional vestments and church furnishings were used. The Ornaments Rubric reversed a rubric in the 1552 Prayer Book that prohibited clergy from wearing albs, vestments, or copes.&nbsp; The Elizabethan edition of 1559 deleted the &quot;Black Rubric&quot; from the 1552 BCP, which stated that no adoration of any real presence was intended by kneeling at communion. It retained the receptionistic formula of administration of communion from the 1552 BCP (&quot;Take and eat this in remembrance . . . &quot;), but this was preceded by the more traditional sentence of administration from the 1549 BCP (&quot;The Body of our Lord Jesus Christ which was given for thee. . . .&quot;). This combination of sentences of administration allowed considerable latitude of belief concerning the eucharist. The Elizabethan edition of 1559 also dropped from the litany a petition for deliverance from the tyranny of the Bishop of Rome and all his detestable enormities. This petition was understandably offensive to Elizabeth&#039;s Roman Catholic subjects. The continuity of the Church of England in apostolic succession was strongly upheld under Elizabeth. The consecration of Matthew Parker (1504-1575) as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1559 was done with great care to make sure that the line of English bishops in apostolic succession was unbroken. Although Elizabeth would have preferred a celibate clergy, clerical marriage was permitted as an indulgence. The Elizabethan settlement was foundational for the via media that has become characteristic of Anglicanism. Through this settlement the English church was comprehensive and inclusive, catholic and protestant, but neither Roman Catholic nor Genevan Protestant. See Receptionism; see Via Media. &nbsp;",

        "Emancipation, African American, and the Episcopal Church",
        "Beginning with the founding of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts in 1701, Anglican slave holders sought to incorporate African Americans within the traditions of Anglicanism. In the nineteenth century, evangelicals developed an active, paternalistic ministry among slaves. White Episcopalians encouraged household servants to sit in special sections in their churches and occasionally allowed separate African American congregations (guided by white clergy) to be formed. But when emancipation came, most ex-slaves chose the Baptist and Methodist denominations instead of the Episcopal Church. At the 1868 General Convention, all southern dioceses reported major losses of African Americans. South Carolina had the most dramatic decline, with a reduction of nearly ninety percent of its African American membership. The Episcopal Church had limited appeal in the African American community. Most southern dioceses refused to grant equal status to African American communicants, and most African American parishes were led by white clergy. The 1865 General Convention attempted to address this problem by creating the Protestant Episcopal Freedman&#039;s Commission as an agency for the evangelization and education of ex-slaves. But the commission often lacked funding and was eventually dissolved in 1878. A report to the 1877 General Convention noted that there were only thirty-seven congregations and fifteen African American Episcopal clergy among the four million African Americans in the southern states. The freeing of slaves after the Civil War had a negative effect on the institutional strength of the Episcopal Church in the South. Episcopalians experienced &quot;a wholesale exodus&quot; of African Americans from their denomination in the late 1860s.",

        "Enlightenment, The",
        "An intellectual and cultural development which emphasized the ability of human reason to grasp the ultimate meaning of life and creation in terms of self-evident truths. It was widespread in western Europe during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The Enlightenment upheld the autonomy of human reason and reason&#039;s adequacy to grasp and shape the world by its own power. In Enlightenment terms, truth was self-authenticating by virtue of its inherent reasonableness. This differed from orthodox Christian theology, which held that truth came from beyond reason by revelation.&nbsp;<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\tThe Enlightenment understanding of reason was based in the natural sciences, and it was characterized by skepticism concerning the NT miracles. This skepticism concerning the miracles was expressed in David Hume&#039;s Essay on Miracles(1748), which noted the absence of contemporary analogs of miracles, and concluded that no human testimony could establish the reality of such events without analogs. The Enlightenment was critical of the idea of supernatural revelation, and viewed the contingent truths of history as much less significant than the necessary truths of reason. The Bible was not distinguished from other literary forms on the basis of divine revelation, and it was considered in light of the same forms of textual analysis as other works of literature. Jesus was understood as merely different in degree from other human beings relative to certain qualities. He was understood to be a great moral teacher of enlightened truths, not a supernatural redeemer. Jesus&#039; death was understood as a supreme moral example of self-giving. His death and resurrection were minimized in importance relative to his teaching and example. The Enlightenment understanding of Jesus inspired the &quot;quest&quot; for the historical Jesus who was believed to be concealed behind the NT accounts. The Enlightenment also rejected the doctrine of original sin, and the Christian doctrine of redemption.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\tThe inductive method of Francis Bacon, the empiricism of John Locke, and the mathematical cosmology of Isaac Newton were formative for the English Enlightenment. The purest example of Enlightenment theology in England is afforded by the Deists, who were hostile to revealed religion. Deism was opposed by, among others, Locke and Joseph Butler. Locke understood Christianity as a reasonable supplement to natural religion, which maintained a place for divine revelation. Butler&#039;s elaborate work The Analogy of Reason (1736) argued for both natural and revealed religion on the basis of ingenious analogies from nature itself. The Enlightenment ideal of a universal rationality proved elusive to discover as many perspectives appeared concerning the meaning of self-evident truths and principles.

        "Entrance Rite",
        "The liturgical gathering of the people as the worshiping community at the beginning of the eucharist. The entrance rite prepares the congregation for the liturgy of the word. Until the fourth or fifth centuries, the eucharistic liturgy typically began with the celebrant&apos;s salutation and the first reading. As Christian worship became more formalized, entrance rites became more elaborate. The ministers entered in procession, with the gospel book carried in procession. The entrance rite has at times become cumbersome with too many additions, which can distract instead of preparing the people to hear the Word of God.The entrance rite of the 1979 BCP includes the entrance of the ministers and may begin with a hymn, psalm, or anthem. A seasonal acclamation follows. The collect for purity is optional in Rite 2 eucharistic liturgies but is required in Rite 1. Then may follow the Gloria in excelsis or another song of praise, or the Kyrie eleison, or the Trisagion. The Gloria in excelsis or other hymn of praise is to be used from Christmas Day through the Feast of Epiphany and throughout the Easter season. The salutation is followed by the collect of the day. The BCP provides special entrance rites for the Proper Liturgies for Special Days such as Palm Sunday and the Easter Vigil, for Baptism, for pastoral offices such as Marriage and Burial, and for episcopal services such as Ordination and the Consecration of a Church. Other options for the entrance rite include A Penitential Order (BCP, p. 351), which is especially appropriate for Lent or other penitential occasions; the Great Litany (p. 148); and the Order of Worship for Evening (p. 109). The BCP prescribes use of the Order of Worship for Evening as the entrance rite for the Vigil of Pentecost (p. 227). The BOS calls for its use at the Vigil Eucharist of other baptismal feasts, the First Sunday after the Epiphany, and All Saints&apos; Day or the Sunday after All Saints&apos; Day.

        "The invocation of the active presence of the Holy Spirit in the eucharistic prayer so that the bread and wine may become the body and blood of Christ. The presider at the eucharist may extend his or her hands over the gifts at the epiclesis. The term is based on the Greek word that means &#8220;to call upon,&#8221; &#8220;to invoke.&#8221; The epiclesis typically follows the institution narrative (see eucharistic prayers A, B, and D, BCP, pp. 363, 369, 375), but it precedes the institution narrative in eucharistic prayer C (BCP, p. 371). The Roman Mass did not have an explicit epiclesis, although recent reforms in the Roman Church have added prayers of epiclesis. Thomas Cranmer placed the epiclesis prior to the institution narrative in the 1549 Prayer Book, but he replaced it with a prayer for worthy reception of communion in the 1552 BCP. The epiclesis was not reintroduced in the 1662 BCP. Scottish reformers restored the epiclesis, and the Scottish Book of 1637 included the petition that God the Father would &#8220;vouchsafe to bless and sanctify with thy word and Holy Spirit these thy gifts and creatures of bread and wine, that they may be unto us the body and blood of thy most dearly beloved Son. . . .&#8221; The Episcopal Church followed the Scottish rather than the English model with respect to the epiclesis. An epiclesis in some form has been included in the eucharistic prayers of the Episcopal Church since the 1789 BCP. The epiclesis of Prayer I in Rite 1 of the BCP is substantially the same as that in the 1789 BCP. See Holy Spirit.",

These showings of his divinity included his birth, the coming of the Magi, his baptism, and the Wedding at Cana where he miraculously changed water into wine. The day was called &quot;The Feast of Lights.&quot; Celebration of the Son of God replaced celebration of the sun. Baptisms were done, and a season of preparation was instituted. It was later called Advent. The solstice was kept on Dec. 25 by the fourth century. Jesus&#039; birth was celebrated on this day in both eastern and western churches. The western church commemorated the coming of the Magi on Jan. 6. The eastern church continued to celebrate the Baptism of our Lord and the Wedding at Cana on Jan. 6. In the east the day was called &quot;Theophany&quot; (manifestation of God). The coming of the Magi is celebrated on the Feast of the Epiphany, Jan. 6, in the BCP.

        "Episcopal Church Flag and Seal",
        "On Oct. 16, 1940, the House of Bishops and the House of Deputies adopted an official flag for the Episcopal Church. This was the 251st anniversary of the day the General Convention ratified the Constitution and Canons and adopted the BCP. It was designed by William M. Baldwin (d. 1942), a member of the Cathedral of the Incarnation, Long Island, New York. The symbolism of the flag has been explained as follows: The white field represents the purity of the Christian religion. The red cross represents the sacrifice of Jesus and the blood of the martyrs. The red cross on a white field is the cross of Saint George, the patron saint of England, indicating our descent from the Church of England. The blue in the upper left-hand corner is the light blue of the sky, often used by artists for the clothing of the Blessed Virgin. It is called Madonna blue and represents the human nature of our Lord, which he received from his mother. The nine white crosslets on the blue field represent the nine original dioceses of the Episcopal Church in America in 1789: Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, and South Carolina. They are arranged in the form of a St. Andrew&apos;s Cross to commemorate the fact that Samuel Seabury, the first American bishop, was consecrated in Aberdeen, Scotland, on Nov. 14, 1784. The colors red, white, and blue represent the United States and stand for the American branch of the Anglican Communion. The same design is incorporated in the Episcopal Church seal, which was also adopted by the 1940 General Convention. The seal and flag serve as emblems of the Episcopal Church. The design is seen on signs, publications, decals, letterheads, pins, and many other places. Some congregations display the Episcopal Church flag and the American flag in the church or parish hall.",

The school was founded at Cambridge, Massachusetts, by a group of prominent Boston businessmen in 1867 to be a place of preparation for holy orders and an Episcopal presence at Harvard University. It provided a place of worship for Episcopal undergraduates. All Harvard undergraduates were required to attend Sunday worship in either the Harvard Chapel or their church of choice. The board of trustees was limited to lay persons. The faculty were required to assert belief in justification by faith upon assuming their teaching duties. It was the first Episcopal theological seminary to welcome modern biblical scholarship. It was also the first Episcopal seminary to introduce into the curriculum courses in sociology taught by a professor of sociology, the first Episcopal seminary to establish a chair in the history of religion and mission, and the first Episcopal seminary to appoint a woman to a full-time faculty position (Professor Adelaide Teague Case in 1941). ETS has been associated with controversy at various times. Creeds and Loyalty, a collection of seven faculty essays on the issue of creedal literalism, was published in 1924. Professor Joseph Fletcher&apos;s exposition of situation ethics in the 1960s was also controversial.

        "Eschatology",
        "Theology of the last things, the end of time and history, the coming of the Kingdom of God. Use of the term dates from the nineteenth century. It is from the Greek, eschatos, &#8220;last.&#8221; Eschatology concerns the final end and meaning of all things, but it is possible to distinguish individual, social, and universal aspects of eschatology. The Christian hope is centered in the victorious Christ, who will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead and whose kingdom will have no end (see the Nicene Creed, BCP, p. 359; and the Apostles&apos; Creed, BCP, p. 96). Some approaches to eschatology emphasize the coming of the Kingdom of God as a radical break from the existence of creation as we know it, or a breaking into time from the future. Other approaches emphasize that the power of God&apos;s Kingdom was inaugurated in Christ&apos;s life, death, and resurrection, and that God&apos;s power for salvation and the fulfillment of all things is currently active in history. Thomas Aquinas understood the ultimate end and perfect happiness of humanity in terms of union with God, which may be described as the beatific vision. He also held that each thing intends as its ultimate end to be united to God as closely as possible for it. The NT scholar C.H. Dodd presented a &#8220;realized eschatology&#8221; in which the perfect fulfillment of the messianic hope is realized in Jesus&apos; incarnate life and earthly ministry. The Kingdom of God may be understood as already present through Christ&apos;s resurrection and yet to be fulfilled perfectly when Christ returns at the end of time. The theme of Christian expectation for the coming of Christ in power and glory is given liturgical expression in the season of Advent. The Prayer Book Catechism states that &#8220;the Christian hope is to live with confidence in newness and fullness of life, and to await the coming of Christ in glory, and the completion of God&apos;s purpose for the world&#8221; (BCP, p. 861). The Catechism section on the Christian Hope considers such eschatological themes as the meaning of the coming of Christ in glory, the meaning of heaven and hell, prayers for the dead, the meaning of the last judgment, the meaning of the resurrection of the body, the communion of saints, the meaning of everlasting life, and the Christian assurance (BCP, p. 862).",

In Christian understanding, the resurrection of Jesus was the anticipation of the eschaton. The resurrection signals a preliminary victory over sin and death and points to the final victory.

        "Terms for characterizing the significance of a doctrine or practice for the church. Esse indicates that which is of the essence of the very existence of the life of the church. Bene esse indicates that which is of benefit for the life of the church. Plene esse indicates that which is of the fullness of the Church&#039;s life. These terms have been frequently used with respect to the role of the historic episcopate in the life of the church. This question has often been raised in the context of ecumenical discussions, especially with churches that do not have an episcopal ministry and do not require episcopal ordination of clergy. The statement &quot;No bishop, no Church&quot; would reflect the position that the historic episcopate is of the esse of the church. This view, strictly applied, serves to &quot;unchurch&quot; Protestant denominations that do not have the episcopate. It also serves to restrict severely the possibilities for Anglican ecumenical relations with these churches.&nbsp;<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\tThe historic episcopate (as locally adapted) was identified by the Quadrilateral adopted by the House of Bishops in 1886 as one of the four parts of the sacred deposit of the faith that are &quot;essential to the restoration of unity among the divided branches of Christendom.&quot; The historic episcopate was likewise identified by the Lambeth Conference of 1888 as one of the four bases for Home Reunion. See the Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral 1886, 1888 (BCP, pp. 876-878). The other three &quot;essential&quot; parts identified by the House of Bishops in 1886 were the Holy Scriptures of the OT and NT as the revealed Word of God; the Nicene Creed as the sufficient statement of Christian faith; and the two sacraments of Baptism and the Supper of the Lord, ministered with unfailing use of Christ&#039;s words of institution and of the elements ordained by Christ. The other three elements of the Lambeth Conference Resolution of 1888 are similar to the Chicago declaration, except that the Apostles&#039; Creed as the Baptismal Symbol is mentioned along with the Nicene Creed as the sufficient statement of Christian faith.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\tThe distinction of esse and bene esse with respect to the episcopate can be traced to the thought of Richard Hooker (c. 1554-1600). He believed that the apostles left bishops with authority above other pastors and that the church has power to determine its own positive law and governance. But Hooker also believed that episcopacy does not belong to &quot;the essence of Christianity.&quot; On the other hand, nineteenth-century Tractarians took the position that Christ created the apostolic order. For example, in Tract 4, John Keble (1792-1866) doubted that there was assurance and safety for salvation except in the sacraments of the apostolic Church of England. Keble and other Tractarians believed that episcopacy was of the esse of the church.</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\tThe term plene esse was used in essays by H. W. Montefiore and Kenneth M. Carey in The Historic Episcopate (1954), edited by Carey. This collection of essays was published in response to the controversy concerning whether the Church of England should enter into full communion with the Church of South India. In the Church of South India, episcopal and non-episcopal churches came together on an episcopal basis. Clergy who had not been episcopally ordained were not reordained by bishops. But all future ordinands were to be episcopally ordained, so that the Church of South India would eventually be an episcopal church whose clergy were all episcopally ordained. Carey admits that the interim presence of nonepiscopally ordained clergy was an admitted &quot;anomaly&quot; for an episcopal church. Nevertheless, the essays by Montefiore and Carey support full communion with the Church of South India because the episcopate is of the plene esse, or fullness, of the church-not the essence. In 1955 the Convocations of Canterbury and York approved limited inter-communion between the Church of England and the Church of South India. A similar plan and understanding of episcopacy was the basis of the proposed Lutheran-Episcopal Concordat (1991).

        "Establishment of Religion",
        "An arrangement in which a religion or a particular religious institution enjoys official status and the state may enforce conformity. The establishment of Christianity began with Constantine the Great (d. 337) who first tolerated Christianity instead of persecuting it, and then later actively sought to make it the official religion of the Roman Empire. Established Christianity was understood as ordering the ends of the state as well as providing for the salvation of individuals. It was expected to legitimate the authority and actions of the state. This was expressed in the duty of Christians to fight for the preservation and ends of the state and in the duty of the state to suppress and punish false religion and doctrine. In terms of faith, Christianity became less a matter of conscious decision and commitment and more a matter of birth and assimilation into the surrounding culture. No longer was there a process of initiation (the catechumenate) in preparation for adult baptism. Instead, all citizens were baptized at birth so that &#8220;Christian&#8221; became just another word for citizen. In this context, religious orders became &#8220;a higher way&#8221; which transcended the roles and relations of citizen to state and thereby at times challenged the authority of the state. With the Protestant Reformation and a renewed sense of the individual decision of faith, the increase of religious bodies, and the rise of the nation-state seeking to secure itself amidst competing religious bodies, establishment of religion gave way to religious freedom. This change ultimately led, in fact if not in principle, to the secular state. Anglicanism follows this development, moving from exclusive establishment at the time of the English Reformation, to increased religious toleration, to an established church in a secular state. Although the Church of England continues as an established church, the Anglican Communion worldwide is seen as a denomination whose churches are spread throughout the world by voluntary membership apart from the efforts of the state.",

One approach emphasizes human fulfillment and happiness and results in a teleological ethic focusing on ends. The other approach emphasizes moral duty and results in a deontological ethic focusing on moral obligations apart from ends. Since Aristotle, three questions have shaped the discipline of ethics: 1) What is the nature of what is good or right? 2) What is the nature of human understanding and action, or how do you come to know and do the good or right? 3) What are the criteria for judging actions?

The term is from the Greek, &#8220;thanksgiving.&#8221; Jesus instituted the eucharist &#8220;on the night when he was betrayed.&#8221; At the Last Supper he shared the bread and cup of wine at a sacred meal with his disciples. He identified the bread with his body and the wine with his blood of the new covenant. Jesus commanded his disciples to &#8220;do this&#8221; in remembrance of him (see 1 Cor 11:23-26; Mk 14:22-25; Mt 26:26-29; Lk 22:14-20). Christ&apos;s sacrifice is made present by the eucharist, and in it we are united to his one self-offering (BCP, p. 859). The Last Supper provides the basis for the fourfold eucharistic action of taking, blessing, breaking, and sharing. Christ&apos;s body and blood are really present in the sacrament of the eucharist and received by faith. Christ&apos;s presence is also known in the gathered eucharistic community.In the BCP, the whole service is entitled the Holy Eucharist. The first part of the service is designated the Word of God. It usually includes the entrance rite, the lessons and gradual psalm, the gospel, the sermon, the Nicene Creed, the prayers of the people, the confession of sin and absolution, and the peace. The second portion of the service is designated the Holy Communion. It includes the offertory, the consecration of the bread and wine in the Great Thanksgiving, the communion of the people, and the concluding prayers of thanksgiving and dismissal. A blessing may be given prior to the dismissal. The eucharist is also called the Lord&apos;s Supper, Holy Communion, the Divine Liturgy, the Mass, and the Great Offertory (BCP, p. 859). The Hymnal 1982 includes a section with a variety of hymns for the Holy Eucharist (300-347), including &#8220;Come, risen Lord, and deign to be our guest&#8221; (305-306), &#8220;My God, thy table now is spread&#8221; (321), &#8220;Now, my tongue, the mystery telling&#8221; (329-331), and &#8220;I am the bread of life&#8221; (335).",

Private eucharistic adoration often involves prayer near the tabernacle or aumbry where the sacrament is reserved. Corporate acts of adoration include Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament and Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament. Article XXV of the Articles of Religion protested against eucharistic adoration, stating that &#8220;The Sacraments were not ordained of Christ to be gazed upon, or to be carried about, but that we should duly use them&#8221; (BCP, p. 872). The BCP does not include forms for the services of Benediction or Exposition. But forms for these services are found in some devotional books such as Saint Augustine&apos;s Prayer Book. Eucharistic adoration is an important aspect of the prayer life of some members of the Episcopal Church, especially those with an Anglo-catholic piety. James DeKoven, the most widely known and respected leader of the Anglo-catholic movement in the nineteenth century, defended eucharistic adoration at the General Conventions of 1871 and 1874. He urged that &#8220;to adore Christ&apos;s person in His Sacrament, is the inalienable privilege of every Christian and Catholic heart.&#8221;",

        "Bread and wine that are consecrated in the eucharist. The bread recalls the work of human hands required to harvest the wheat and make the bread, and the companionship of sharing. The wine recalls festivity and celebration, along with sacrifice. These elements of the communal meal are offered by the congregation and blessed during the Great Thanksgiving. The bread and wine of the eucharist are commonly called &#8220;elements&#8221; or &#8220;species.&#8221; The elements are the outward and visible sign in the sacrament of the eucharist and the matter of the sacrament. The body and blood of Christ are understood to be really present in the eucharistic elements after consecration. They represent the inward and spiritual grace of Christ&#8217;s Body and Blood that is given to his people and received by faith (BCP, p. 859).Following a widespread and ancient tradition, congregations of the Episcopal Church use bread made from wheat and wine made from grapes. Other sources of bread and wine may be more appropriate in other cultures. The bread may be leavened or unleavened. It may be in the form of wafers or a loaf that is broken for distribution. No particular kind or color of wine is required, although many prefer red wine as a symbol of sacrifice and Christ&#8217;s blood. It is an increasingly common practice to use loaf bread made by members of the congregation. Homemade or local wine may also be used. The BCP makes no provision for the replacement of bread and wine with other eucharistic elements. For example, unfermented grape juice is not used for the eucharist in the Episcopal Church.

        "Eucharistic Sacrifice",
        "That which is offered to God in the Holy Communion. The identification of Jesus&apos; sacrifice with the eucharist is derived from the Last Supper, when Jesus identified the bread with his body and the wine with his blood of the new covenant (see 1 Cor 11:23-26; Mk 14:22-25). The Letter to the Hebrews describes Christ as the high priest who is the mediator of the new covenant through his once-for-all sacrifice (see Heb 9). Identification of the eucharist as a sacrificial action has been dated from the early third century. However, abuses and exaggerations had become associated with the eucharist by the Reformation era, including the popular concept of the Mass as a repetition of Jesus&apos; death on Calvary. Reactions against this understanding were reflected in the sixteenth-century liturgies of the Lutheran and Anglican churches. Article XXXI of the Articles of Religion denied the efficacy of sacrifice other than Christ&apos;s (BCP, p. 874). Anglicans in the Puritan, low-church, and evangelical traditions have closely followed Article XXXI, spurning mention of any sacrifice other than the &#8220;full, perfect, and sufficient sacrifice, oblation, and satisfaction&#8221; of Jesus&apos; death. Eucharist is not sacrifice in these traditions, and eucharist can only recollect the one sacrifice of Christ. On the other hand, Anglicans in the high church and catholic traditions have taught that eucharist always involves sacrifice. These traditions typically hold that eucharist requires believers to join their lives with Christ&apos;s one sacrifice. The eucharistic prayers in the BCP reflect our sacramental participation in the once-for-all sacrifice of our Lord. Eucharistic Prayer B states that &#8220;we offer our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving to you, O Lord of all; presenting to you, from your creation, this bread and this wine,&#8221; and asks that God may &#8220;Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit&#8221; (BCP, p. 369).

Over them was the stole, the maniple on the left wrist, and most conspicuously the chasuble (a robe covering front, back, and shoulders). These three were usually of fine fabric with ornamental needlework, with different liturgical colors being used for different days. In medieval times, symbolic meanings were attached to each item. Although they were disallowed in England in the sixteenth century, they were revived in the nineteenth century following the Oxford Movement. Evangelicals opposed them, preferring the customary Anglican surplice with tippet or stole. Today, with less polemical associations, eucharistic vestments are widely used in most Episcopal parishes. The maniple and amice are now typically omitted. The amice may be replaced by a hood attached to the alb. The girdle may be omitted.",

Eutyches was caught up in the controversy then raging over the relationship between the humanity and divinity of Christ. He opposed Nestorianism, a heretical teaching which held that Christ was two persons, one divine and one human, as well as two natures in moral union. Eutyches taught that Christ was one person (hypostasis or prosopon) with just one nature. Hence, Eutychianism is also called monophysitism. It is not clear whether Eutyches held the one nature of Christ to be simply divine, or whether it was a &#8220;third thing&#8221; between divinity and humanity. He taught that Christ&apos;s one nature was not consubstantial with our humanity. His Christology was unbalanced because he did not uphold the full humanity of Christ. This teaching led his followers toward Docetism. Eutychianism was condemned by the Council of Chalcedon. Eutychianism has been characterized as the opposite and symmetrical error of Nestorianism.

The Evangelical Church is the official name of the church formed in Germany by the union of Lutherans and Calvinists. In England a movement in the eighteenth century formed under the leadership of John and Charles Wesley and George Whitfield was called indiscriminately &quot;methodist&quot; or &quot;evangelical.&quot; English evangelical teaching was characterized by emphasis on atoning sanctification and marked by &quot;enthusiasm.&quot; Evangelicals who remained within the Church of England formed an evangelical or low church party, often at odds with the Laudian, catholic, or high church party.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\t&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n\tThe evangelical movement in the Episcopal Church was influenced strongly by the Great Awakening in America during the mid-eighteenth century. Episcopal evangelicals reflected American evangelicalism in many ways, including a characteristic emphasis on personal religion and religious emotion, personal conversion, the authority of the Bible as centered in the revelation of God in Christ, the importance of justification by faith, the preaching of the Word and the study of the gospel, the centrality of the cross for salvation, the importance of the believer&#039;s direct relationship with God, and a desire for pure and undefiled religion which included a strong aversion to worldliness and threats to public morals. Episcopal evangelicals attended prayer meetings which included informal prayers and enthusiastic singing of hymns. Evangelicals wrote many of the hymns that were used in the first years of the Episcopal Church. Evangelicals in the Episcopal Church used the Prayer Book and participated in the sacraments, but they did not emphasize the importance of sacramental form or the importance of apostolic succession. They saw much value in the less liturgical style of other Protestant churches and were impatient with canonical restrictions that prevented their participation in the services of other Protestant denominations or the participation of other Protestant ministers in Episcopal services. They were opposed to ritual excess, which they associated with the Roman Catholic Church. Bishop Charles P. McIlvaine of Ohio challenged the theology of the Oxford Movement in his Oxford Divinity (1841), which identified Oxford divinity with the Roman Catholic Church and urged that both served to undermine the Protestant doctrine of justification by faith. The evangelicals gave rise to the low church party in the Episcopal Church. Evangelicals have been at the center of the overseas missionary work of the Episcopal Church since the 1830s. Noted evangelicals in the Episcopal Church included Bishops Richard Channing Moore and William Meade of Virginia; Philander Chase, Gregory T. Bedell, McIlvaine of Ohio; Alexander Viets Griswold of the Eastern Diocese, who later served as Presiding Bishop; and Alonzo Potter of Pennsylvania. Other notable evangelicals were Elizabeth Channing Moore, and the Rev. William H. Wilmer, who served as president of William and Mary College; and Francis Scott Key, author of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner.&quot; Evangelical principles guided the founding of the Virginia Theological Seminary in Alexandria, Virginia, by Meade, Wilmer, and others; and the founding by Chase of Kenyon College and Gambier Theological Seminary (later Bexley Hall) in Ohio.&nbsp;</div>\n",

        "Evangelicalism first expressed itself in the Episcopal Church during the Great Awakening. From 1811 until 1873, there was a very significant evangelical movement or party within the Episcopal Church. The beginning of the movement can be dated from the consecration of Alexander Viets Griswold as Bishop of the Eastern Diocese on May 29, 1811. The evangelical party stressed adult renewal, whereas the Hobartian high church party stressed the baptismal covenant. Evangelicals stressed the absolute supremacy of the Bible as the only rule of faith and practice, the corruption of human nature by sin, the centrality of the atoning death of Jesus Christ, an experiential knowledge of Christ, a conversion experience, holiness of life, and a deep commitment to the work of mission and evangelism. In 1873 a number of evangelicals left the Episcopal Church and formed the Reformed Episcopal Church. In the twentieth century a liberal evangelical movement emerged. It retained evangelical principles, but combined them with new intellectual ideas such as Darwinism and higher criticism. In the 1970s a conservative evangelicalism emerged in the Episcopal Church. The founding of Trinity Episcopal School for Ministry in 1976 was an expression of that conservative evangelicalism.

The epistle to the Ephesians (4:11) names evangelists after apostles and prophets in the list of ministers in the NT church. Little else is said about evangelists or evangelism except that Philip was an evangelist (Acts 21:8), and Paul urged Timothy to &quot;do the work of an evangelist&quot; (2 Tm 4:5). Later, in the early church, the word &quot;evangelist&quot; was used to describe the writer of a gospel and eventually considered an office. An evangelist is primarily someone who presents God&#039;s message to make known the good news of the life, suffering, and death of Jesus. The evangelist presents the importance and significance of the good news for the people of the evangelist&#039;s own time and cultural situation. Therefore, the message of specific evangelists can differ from what others have said, even though they are all presenting the good news. The term &quot;evangelist&quot; is now often used to refer to someone who is dedicated to evangelism or missionary work. The 1988 Lambeth Conference summarized evangelism simply as &quot;the making of new Christians.&quot; It also asked each province and diocese of the Anglican Communion to make the closing years of this millennium a &quot;Decade of Evangelism&quot; with a renewed and united emphasis on making Christ known to the people of his world. The General Convention of 1991 designated the 1990s a &quot;&#039;Decade of Evangelism,&#039; during which we will reclaim and affirm our baptismal call to evangelism and will endeavor, with other Christian denominations, to reach every unchurched person in the nine Provinces of the Episcopal Church with the Gospel of Jesus Christ.&quot; Evangelism is virtually synonymous with mission.",

A third exhortation was added in the 1552 BCP. The 1928 BCP also included three exhortations, but the 1979 BCP has only one, a conflation of prior material (pp. 316-317). The exhortation is not printed with the Rite 2 eucharistic liturgy. The BCP allows the exhortation to be used in whole or in part during the liturgy or at other times. The exhortation recalls the institution of the eucharist and its benefits for a spiritual sharing in Christ&apos;s risen life and for making us one with Christ and members one of another. It also gives thanks to God for the creation of the world, for God&apos;s continual providence and love for us, for the Incarnation and our redemption through Christ, who died to &#8220;make us the children of God by the power of the Holy Spirit, and exalt us to everlasting life.&#8221; As a public spiritual direction, the exhortation calls on the people to make a worthy approach to the eucharist, including examination of their lives and conduct. It advises those who &#8220;need help and counsel&#8221; to seek a suitable priest and make a sacramental confession of sin.

Popular devotion to the sacrament and the desire to see, rather than to receive, was characteristic of the late middle ages. Exposition was a method of extending this time. A monstrance may be used for exhibition of the Host. A monstrance is a gold or silver frame, usually in the form of a cross or a sunburst, with a glass case through which the host may be seen in the center. Exposition can also form the focus of a service of Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament, an extra-liturgical devotion, in which hymns (usually the eucharistic hymns of Thomas Aquinas) are sung and the priest blesses the people with the sacrament. Exposition ceased in the Church of England at the Reformation but was reintroduced by Anglo-catholics in the late nineteenth century. The BCP makes no provision for exposition, but it may be seen in parishes with an Anglo-catholic piety. The significance of exposition may be questioned relative to the proper use of the sacrament for the communion of the people of God.",

Baptismal candidates fasted for up to two days before their baptism. By the late middle ages abstinence from food was required before the reception of communion, and western Christians also fasted during Lent by abstaining from meat. As a spiritual discipline, fasting is an act of contrition, cleansing, and preparation. The BCP recommends fasting for the season of Lent, which Christians should observe &#8220;by self-examination and repentance; by prayer, fasting, and self-denial; and by reading and meditating on God&apos;s Word&#8221; (BCP, p. 265). The BCP designates the weekdays of Lent and Holy Week and all Fridays except in the seasons of Christmas and Easter as days of &#8220;special devotion&#8221; with &#8220;special acts of discipline and self-denial&#8221; (which normally include fasting). An exception is made for the feast of the Annunciation in Lent and feasts of our Lord on Friday.

He became supply priest at St. George&apos;s Church in Flushing, and later became the rector. Several men in Flushing wanted to establish an academy for boys and asked Muhlenberg to be the head instructor. He accepted, and the school opened in the spring of 1828. Muhlenberg served in this position for eighteen years. He made the school the model for other church schools in the United States. Flushing Institute stressed the ideals of a Christian atmosphere, the role of the Bible in the curriculum, physical education, and a sense of family life. One of the most famous schools influenced by Flushing is St. Paul&apos;s School, Concord, New Hampshire. Flushing Institute closed in 1848.

Grafton&apos;s bishop coadjutor was consecrated with a fullness of ceremonial that was unprecedented in the Episcopal Church. All officiating bishops wore copes and miters. Chrism was used in the consecration, and the newly ordained bishop was given an episcopal ring and a pastoral staff. Bishops from the Russian Orthodox Church and the Polish National (Old) Catholic Church were also present and fully vested in accordance with their traditions. Considerable uproar resulted in some parts of the Episcopal Church when a picture of the assembled bishops was published in The Living Church.

Many fonts remained large even after infant baptism became the norm, but they were raised above ground for convenience.

        "The washing of feet was a menial act of hospitality in the OT (see Gn 18:4, 19:2). It was often performed for guests by a servant or the wife of the host. The Gospel of John (13:1-17) records that Jesus washed the feet of the disciples at the Last Supper. Jesus urged the disciples to follow his example of generous and humble service. They should wash one another&#039;s feet, as their feet had been washed by Jesus, their Lord and Teacher. Jesus&#039; washing of the disciples&#039; feet was a lived expression of his teaching that &quot;whoever wishes to be first among you must be slave of all&quot; (Mk 10:43-44). The foot-washing also expressed Jesus&#039; &quot;new commandment&quot; for his disciples to love one another, as he had loved them (Jn 13:34). The washing of feet continued in the early Christian church. The requirements for enrollment on the list of widows includes the expectation that a widow would have &quot;washed the saints&#039; feet&quot; (1 Tm 4:9-10). The ceremonial washing of feet is mentioned by Augustine of Hippo (354-430). The foot-washing has been associated with the Maundy Thursday liturgy since the seventh century in Spain. The name &quot;Maundy&quot; is from the Latin antiphon that was used on this day, based on Jesus&#039; &quot;new commandment&quot; of love on the Thursday before his death. The foot-washing has also been associated with baptism. In the ancient Gallican rites, the feet of the newly baptized were washed by the ranking prelate after baptism. The early editions of the Prayer Book did not provide for the foot-washing. The 1979 BCP restored the washing of feet as an option for the Maundy Thursday service. The foot-washing follows the gospel and homily. Representatives of the congregation may be appointed to have their feet washed by the celebrant. The celebrant may be assisted by other ministers or acolytes. The BCP provides anthems that may be sung or said during the ceremony (pp. 274-275). Musical settings for these anthems are available in the Appendix of The Hymnal 1982 Accompaniment Edition, Vol. 1 (S 344-S 347). It is also traditional to use the hymn &quot;Ubi Caritas&quot; at the foot-washing (see Hymns 576, 577, 581, 606). The BOS provides a brief address that may be used by the celebrant to introduce the ceremony of foot-washing. This statement recalls Jesus&#039; teaching that &quot;strength and growth in the life of the Kingdom of God come not by power, authority, or even miracle, but by such lowly service&quot; as the washing of feet.",

        "A scholarly method used for the interpretation of biblical texts. A form is a passage or unit of biblical material. It has a structure that is considered self-consistent. Units include miracle story, pronouncement story, legend, and saying. Herman Gunkel is an important OT form critic; Martin Dibelius and Rudolf Bultmann are two of the most important NT form critics. Form criticism assumes that a unit was transmitted orally before being written. Form criticism is often described as a search for the &#8220;history of the tradition.&#8221; Form criticism considers how the forms were transmitted orally before they were written in the document where they now exist. Since the material in the Bible represents a later written stage, this method works backward from the complex written form toward the much simpler oral form. It is assumed that the forms were modified or edited as they were transmitted. The goal is to reconstruct a hypothetical, earlier, oral tradition. Some &#8220;form critics,&#8221; such as Vincent Taylor, do not emphasize the importance of the history of the tradition. Their analysis of the form is simply a recognition of its literary features. Most form critics seek to understand the &#8220;situation of life&#8221; (Sitz im Leben) of the early church and gospel writers or editors when they wrote down the modified material. Form criticism evolved into redaction criticism, the search for the theology of an editor, such as Matthew or Mark, and the rationale for their own distinctive gospel forms and stories.

Throughout the history of the church the manner and location of the fraction have varied. The 1662 Prayer Book directed that the fraction take place at the words &#8220;he brake&#8221; in the institution narrative of the eucharistic prayer, thereby emphasizing its relation to Christ&apos;s action at the Last Supper. This practice continued through the 1928 BCP. Marion Hatchett notes that the fraction is returned to its traditional place in the 1979 BCP, which places the fraction immediately after the Lord&apos;s Prayer (p. 364). The fraction should not be hurried, or cluttered with allegorical gestures. The BCP calls for silence at the initial breaking of the bread. This silence should continue as the celebrant replaces the bread on the paten. The celebrant then breaks the bread for distribution. This may be accompanied by a fraction anthem, also known as the confractorium, which may be sung or said. Other priests may assist the celebrant in breaking the bread, and deacons may also assist in the absence of a sufficient number of priests. The pouring of consecrated wine into additional chalices may also be done during the fraction anthem, prior to the celebrant&apos;s invitation for the people to receive communion.

All creatures are worthy of our respect as sisters and brothers. Francis&apos;s disciples, the Mendicant Friars (Franciscans, or First Order of St. Francis), owned no property, lived from alms, and were devoted to itinerant popular preaching. The Sisters of St. Clare (Clarists, or Second Order) practice Franciscan poverty in a cloistered life. A Third Order associates lay people in the same ideal. St. Francis&apos;s primitive rule (1210) had to be relaxed as more candidates joined the order. St. Bonaventure deepened the contemplative dimension of Franciscan spirituality in The Journey of the Mind to God (1259).

Their active and contemplative life was a departure from previous monastic practice in which the community&apos;s life was in many ways enclosed within the monastery. They depended on begging or their own work to survive. Mendicant orders did not hold corporate possessions. The absolute ban on corporate ownership of property proved impractical. Most mendicant orders relaxed this rule in favor of community control of the order&apos;s resources and individual poverty. The four great mendicant orders in England were the Black Friars (Dominicans), the Grey Friars (Franciscans), the White Friars (Carmelites), and the Austin Friars (Augustinians).",

Shortly thereafter, his wife began enclosing her letter to the spouses of retired bishops. Wyatt called his letter The Front Row because bishops move forward in the House of Bishops so that the longest in membership sit on the first rows. Mrs. Wyatt called her letter The Back Row because spouses usually sit in the visitors&apos; gallery at the rear of the house. The letter is now called Front Row/Back Row.

This prayer was added to the Prayer Book in 1662 under the heading, &quot;A General Thanksgiving.&quot; It preceded other prayers of thanksgiving for particular benefits. This prayer asks God to &quot;give us such an awareness of your mercies, that with truly thankful hearts we may show forth your praise, not only with our lips, but in our lives, by giving up our selves to your service, and by walking before you in holiness and righteousness all our days&quot; (BCP, p. 101). The first American Prayer Book (1789) required use of this prayer at every Daily Office. In 1892 its use became optional, except on Sundays when the litany or eucharist did not follow immediately. The prayer appears as &quot;The General Thanksgiving&quot; in the 1979 BCP. It precedes &quot;A Prayer of St. Chrysostom&quot; and the dismissal at the close of Morning Prayer and Evening Prayer (BCP, pp. 58-59, 71-72, 101, 125). Its use is optional. The General Thanksgiving is said by the officiant and the people. The 1979 BCP also includes &quot;A General Thanksgiving&quot; among the Prayers and Thanksgivings found near the end of the BCP (p. 836). This new occasional prayer of thanksgiving was composed by the Rev. Charles P. Price. It thanks God for the splendor of creation, for the blessing of family and friends, for tasks which demand our best efforts, for disappointments that lead us to acknowledge our dependence on God, for Jesus, and for his resurrection that raises us to the life of God&#039;s kingdom, and for the gift of the Spirit through whom we give thanks to God in all things.",

        "General Theological Seminary, The",
        "The oldest seminary of the Episcopal Church, founded by the 1817 General Convention. By 1827 it was located at &#8220;Chelsea Square,&#8221; in New York City, part of the family estate of Clement Clarke Moore. He was the author of &#8220;A Visit from St. Nicholas&#8221; (&#8220;&apos;Twas the night before Christmas&#8221;) and the seminary&apos;s first professor of biblical languages. Its first class graduated in 1822. It was an American center of the Oxford Movement. The General Seminary received authority to grant degrees in 1869 and conferred its first Bachelor of Sacred Theology in 1876. Under its third dean and &#8220;most munificent benefactor,&#8221; Eugene Augustus Hoffman, most of the seminary&apos;s present quadrangle and grounds, buildings, professorships, endowments, and customs were established. The first earned doctoral degree was awarded in 1881, the first honorary doctorate in 1885. By the end of Hoffman&apos;s tenure there were nearly 150 students and thirteen full-time faculty members. The Chapel of the Good Shepherd was consecrated in 1888 by Presiding Bishop John Williams and placed under the spiritual jurisdiction of the Bishops of the Episcopal Church. The St. Mark&apos;s Library, founded in 1820 by John Pintard, also the founder of the New York Historical Society, was from the later nineteenth to the later twentieth century regarded as the finest theological library in the Episcopal Church. Women were first admitted as regular full-time degree students in the fall of 1971. Students were first allowed to marry during the academic term in the fall of 1972.",

Genuflections are often customary in parishes with an Anglo-catholic piety. Genuflections may be seen as people enter or leave a church, or the seating area of a church, or the vicinity of a tabernacle where the Blessed Sacrament is reserved. The celebrant and assisting ministers may genuflect at the end of the eucharistic prayer or after the words of institution concerning each element in the eucharistic prayer. Genuflection has also been associated with veneration of the cross at the Good Friday liturgy and with the affirming of the Incarnation in the Nicene Creed. The genuflection is from imperial and feudal ceremonial. The custom of genuflecting to the Blessed Sacrament dates from the eleventh century, and it was introduced into the Mass in the fourteenth century.

        "Gifts of the Spirit",
        "Five NT texts form the basis for understanding the gifts of the Spirit, known as the charismata in Greek. These texts include 1 Cor 12:1-14:40, Rom 12:8, Eph 4:11-12, Rom 1:11, and 1 Cor 2:14. The lists of gifts in the NT passages are neither exhaustive nor entirely consistent. Apostles, prophets, and teachers are mentioned in 1 Cor 12:28-30. Those who exhort, give, preside, and show mercy are mentioned in Rom 12:6-8. Evangelists and pastors are mentioned in Eph 4:11. These gifts may be understood as charismatic ministries rather than offices. Some gifts, on the other hand, refer to functions or activities. Knowledge, healing, working of miracles, prophecy, tongues, and interpretation of tongues are mentioned in 1 Cor 12:7-10. Some contemporary charismatics consider tongues to be the essential gift of the Spirit, despite Paul&#039;s statement in 1 Cor 14:18-19 that he would rather speak five words with his mind in church to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue. Paul declares that he intends to share his gifts with the Christian church in Rome (Rom 1:11), indicating that gifts can be shared with others. In 1 Cor 12:7, each believer is said to have a gift, which suggests that there are many gifts. These points are prominent in contemporary discussion of the gifts of the Spirit. At baptism, at the sanctifying of the water, the celebrant prays that by the power of the Holy Spirit &quot;those who here are cleansed from sin and born again may continue for ever in the risen life of Jesus Christ our Savior&quot; (BCP, p. 307). In a general sense, the life of faith-including forgiveness and renewal-can be understood as a gift of the Spirit. After the action of baptizing with water, the celebrant prays for specific gifts for the newly baptized from the Lord in the Spirit, including an inquiring and discerning heart, the courage to will and to persevere, a spirit to know and love God, and the gift of joy and wonder in all God&#039;s works (BCP, p. 308). The &quot;sevenfold gifts&quot; imparted to all by the Holy Spirit are mentioned by the hymns Veni Creator Spiritus (Hymns 503-504) and Veni Sancte Spiritus (Hymns 226-227), one of which is sung prior to the prayer of consecration at ordinations of bishops, priests, and deacons.

These glebes sometimes included homes, barns, and slaves. Glebes were usually two hundred or more acres. It could be farmed to supplement the rector&apos;s salary, or it could be leased to others. After the American Revolution, most of the glebes were transferred to the newly organized Protestant Episcopal Church. The Baptists led an effort in Virginia to seize the glebe lands. In Jan. 1802 the Virginia Assembly passed the Act Concerning the Glebe Lands and Churches within this Commonwealth. It provided that each county would have a group called the Overseers of the Poor, which would seize the glebes purchased prior to 1777 upon the death or resignation of the parish&apos;s present rector.

        "Gloria in Excelsis",
        "&#8220;Glory in the highest,&#8221; a short hymn of praise to the Trinity. Its opening verse is based on the song of the angels to the shepherds at the time of Jesus&apos; birth, as reported in Lk 2:14. It is known as the &#8220;Angelic Hymn.&#8221; It is also known as the &#8220;Greater Doxology,&#8221; distinguishing it from the Gloria Patri, the &#8220;Lesser Doxology.&#8221; It dates from the fourth century, and was the canticle for the morning office in the Apostolic Constitutions. It continues to be used in the morning office by the eastern churches. The Gloria became a part of the entrance rite of the Roman Mass in the twelfth century and was dropped from the Daily Office in the west. The Gloria was also used in the eucharistic entrance rite of the 1549 BCP, but later editions used the Gloria as a postcommunion prayer. This reflected the penitential emphasis of those editions of the Prayer Book. The 1789 American Prayer Book allowed the use of the Gloria instead of the Gloria Patri as an option at the end of the psalmody in the Daily Office, but that option is no longer allowed. The 1979 BCP restored the Gloria to its place in the eucharistic entrance rite (pp. 324-325, 356). The Gloria may be used from Christmas Day through the Feast of the Epiphany, on Sundays in Easter season, on all the days of Easter Week, on Ascension Day, and at other times. The Gloria is not used at the eucharist on the Sundays or ordinary weekdays of Advent or Lent (BCP, p. 406). The 1979 BCP uses the Gloria as canticle 20, &#8220;Glory to God.&#8221; It is printed in the Rite 2 service for Morning Prayer, it may be used for Morning Prayer or Evening Prayer, and it is suggested for use at Morning Prayer on Thursday except in Advent and Lent. The Hymnal 1982 provides various musical settings for the Gloria (S 272-S 281), including those by William Mathias (S 278) and Robert Powell (S 280).",

Amen.&quot; The term is from the opening words of the acclamation in Latin. Gloria Patri is also known as the &quot;Lesser Doxology,&quot; distinguishing it from the Gloria in excelsis, the &quot;Greater Doxology.&quot; It may have been influenced by the trinitarian baptismal formula of Mt 28:19. Gloria Patri is always sung or said at the conclusion of the entire portion of the Psalter at Morning Prayer, Noonday Prayer, Evening Prayer, and Compline. It may be used after the invitatory psalm or the canticle &quot;Christ our Passover&quot; at Morning Prayer; and after each psalm, and after each section of Ps 119 at Morning and Evening Prayer (BCP, p. 141). Gloria Patri is used in the BCP to conclude Canticles 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, and 19. It is also used to conclude the Magnificat and the Nunc dimittis in Evening Prayer. Gloria Patri may be omitted after these canticles. It follows the opening versicle and response at Morning Prayer, Noonday Prayer, and Evening Prayer. It follows the confession of sin and a versicle and response from Ps 70:1 at Compline. This pattern of versicle and response is based on the model for the beginning of the Daily Offices prescribed by St. Benedict of Nursia (c. 480-c. 550). Gloria Patri is also used with verses from Ps 44 at the opening of the Supplication. An alternative pointing of the Gloria Patri is provided by the BCP (p. 141). In Rite 1 services of Morning Prayer and Evening Prayer, it is permissible to use the form &quot;Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost: As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.&quot; Gloria Patri was traditionally used to provide a climax and cut-off for psalms that &quot;covered&quot; liturgical actions such as the procession at the entrance of the clergy, the presentation of the oblations, and the communion of the people. A signal would be given when the liturgical action was completed, and the psalm would then end with Gloria Patri. It was not used with gradual psalms or tracts, since these texts were understood to have their own integrity in the service. This tradition continues in modern practice. Gloria Patri is seldom used after the gradual psalm at the eucharist.",

        "(Jan. 22, 1853-Jan. 17, 1932). Theologian and bishop. He was a prolific writer, producing during his lifetime major studies in theology which had an influence far beyond the Church of England. He was also Bishop of Worcester, Birmingham, and Oxford. Gore first came to public attention when he edited Lux Mundi: A Series of Studies in the Religion of the Incarnation (1889), to which he also contributed a major essay on the inspiration of Holy Scripture. The volume itself, which included essays by other members of the University of Oxford, was responsible for the development of what came to be known as liberal catholicism. Gore&apos;s contribution to Anglican theology derived from the Tractarian movement in the Church of England, which sought to revive the Catholic tradition in Anglicanism. The central theme of his extensive theological writing was the Incarnation which, he believed, provided a means for putting the Catholic faith &#8220;in a right relation to modern intellectual and moral problems,&#8221; chief among those being the Darwinian theory of evolution and the critical and historical analysis of Holy Scripture, both of which were a major concern in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. He continued to develop an incarnational theology in his Bampton Lectures, The Incarnation of the Son of God (1891), The Body of Christ (1901), and, after his retirement as Bishop of Oxford, his trilogy Reconstruction of Belief (1921-1924). He also edited A New Commentary on Holy Scripture (1928), which drew together the theology and biblical critical scholarship which Lux Mundi had begun. He was one of the most significant theologians of his era. Gore was also a leading figure in the Christian socialist movement in the Church of England and in the revival of the religious life in the Anglican Communion. Gore&apos;s incarnational theology was influential in the United States. William Porcher DuBose, at the University of the South, and Marshal B. Stewart, at the General Theological Seminary, shared many of the concerns found in Gore&apos;s theology. DuBose and Stewart had considerable influence upon generations of Episcopal clergy.

        "Gospel",
        "The English word &#8220;gospel&#8221; (from Anglo-Saxon godspel) or &#8220;good news&#8221; translates the Greek euangelion. Originally in Christian usage it meant the good news of God&apos;s saving act in Jesus Christ, focused on the cross and resurrection (1 Cor. 15:1-11). The term was used in the opening verse of the Gospel of Mark. It signified that the prefacing of the account of Jesus&apos; death and resurrection with a string of passages or pericopes covering his earlier ministry was a way of proclaiming the good news. The unintended result was that the term became a designation for the literary genre which was created by Mark&apos;s gospel, and it came to be applied to other works of the same genre. The NT contains four gospels-Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Other apocryphal writings, mostly heretical, have been designated as gospels.The gospel in the Episcopal liturgy is the final reading from Holy Scriptures taken from the canonical gospels at the eucharist (BCP, pp. 326, 357). It marks the climax of the liturgy of the word. The gospel may include elaborate ceremonial, such as a gospel procession with two candle bearers and a thurifer. The congregation stands for the gospel, which may be read or sung from the midst of the congregation. The proclamation of the gospel is properly done by a deacon, and in the Episcopal Church the gospel must be proclaimed by a gospeler in holy orders. Acclamations normally precede and follow the gospel. In the Episcopal Church, the Sunday gospel is drawn from the three-year cycle of the lectionary (BCP, pp. 889-921). The gospel may also be read at the Blessing of a Marriage (BCP, p. 426), and at the Burial of the Dead (BCP, pp. 479, 495).  A gospel reading is appointed for each day of the church year by the Daily Office lectionary (BCP, pp. 936-1001). The gospel reading may be used at Morning Prayer or Evening Prayer, and it is the last reading of the lessons. It may be read by a lay person or a member of the clergy.

This distinction has been referred to as &#8220;town and gown.&#8221;The gown has also been used in the liturgy. It was worn with bands. Anglican preachers have worn the gown with hood and scarf for the sermon. This use could be seen as a display of academic credentials by the preacher. Some members of the clergy (especially with a low-church piety) wore the gown throughout the service, following the Genevan practice. Liturgical use of the gown continued into the late nineteenth century. E.

        "God&#8217;s love freely given to humanity for salvation. The term is from the Latin gratia, a &#8220;gift or favor freely given,&#8221; translating the Greek NT charis. Various themes concerning grace have been emphasized since the NT. The Pauline epistles present grace as unmerited and effective as God&#8217;s forgiving love for humanity. The Johannine scriptures present grace as God&#8217;s indwelling of humanity. The western church has generally followed the Pauline emphasis in terms of grace as God&#8217;s forgiveness of sin and healing of humanity for salvation. The eastern church has generally followed the Johannine emphasis of grace as bringing about divinization and human participation in the divine life for salvation.Augustine urged that grace is necessary to free the human will from bondage to sin, making it possible to choose the good. Augustine&#8217;s teaching contradicted Pelagianism, which considered human nature to be able to achieve salvation without special divine assistance, and Semi-Pelagianism, which considered humanity to be capable of initiating the process of salvation that would subsequently be perfected by grace. Aquinas also urged that union with God is impossible for humanity without the help of divine grace. He noted that grace is inwardly received and transformative for new life. Luther emphasized that grace is God&#8217;s absolutely free gift, and not the result of human works. Lutheran thought came to understand justification in terms of imputed righteousness in which the person remains inherently sinful. Calvinist understandings of grace minimized the role of human freedom, emphasizing God&#8217;s predestination of the elect for salvation and the irresistibility of grace. In the Roman Catholic Church, the Council of Trent emphasized the transforming effect of grace in human life and the important role of active human cooperation in salvation.Anglican theology, notably represented by Richard Hooker, has emphasized the gratuitous nature of grace and the importance of participation in the economy of God&#8217;s salvation, especially as known in the life of the church where grace is sacramentally represented and made known. The Catechism notes that grace is &#8220;God&#8217;s favor towards us, unearned and undeserved.&#8221; By grace God &#8220;forgives our sins, enlightens our minds, stirs our hearts, and strengthens our wills.&#8221; The Catechism also states that the sacraments and other sacramental rites of the church are means of grace (BCP, pp. 857-860).The term can also refer to a concluding prayer at the Daily Office, or a prayer of thanksgiving or blessing before a meal.

Because the revival took place especially among the Dutch Reformed, the Congregationalists, the Presbyterians, the Baptists, and some Anglicans, it was largely a development toward evangelical Calvinism. Revival preachers tended to emphasize the &#8220;terrors of the law&#8221; to sinners, the unmerited grace of God, and a &#8220;new birth&#8221; in Jesus Christ. One of the movement&apos;s great figures was George Whitefield, an Anglican priest who was influenced first by John Wesley and then by Calvinists. Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758), the great apologist of the movement, was a strong Calvinist and preached a doctrine of justification by faith. His chief opponent was Charles Chauncy (1704-1787), a Congregational minister of Boston. Chauncy preached against the revival, which he considered an outbreak of extravagant emotion. The Great Awakening was responsible for stemming the tide of Enlightenment rationalism in the colonies. It also led to divisions in some of the denominations between those who supported and those who rejected its tenets. It was responsible for stimulating missions to the Native Americans and the slaves, and for the establishment and growth of several educational institutions, including Princeton, Dartmouth, and Brown. The itinerant preaching associated with the Great Awakening helped to break up the old parish system in which everyone in an area belonged to a single church. It also led to a broader religious toleration and the democratization of religious experience. It contributed to the fervor that resulted in the American Revolution. Although the Anglican Church in America was not strongly affected by the Great Awakening, there was significant participation in this revival by individual Anglican clergy and laity.

        "Great Bible, The",
        "English Bible prepared by Miles Coverdale. The term is based on the size of the Bible. It was printed by Richard Grafton and Edward Whitchurch. It has been called &#8220;Whitchurch&apos;s Bible.&#8221; The printing was begun in Paris but later continued in London owing to the hostility of the Sorbonne. In Sept. 1538, Thomas Cromwell had ordered this Bible to be placed in every parish church. The Great Bible was finally issued in the early summer of 1539. It was based on Coverdale&apos;s Bible (1535), Matthew&apos;s Bible (1537), and the work of William Tyndale. The title page of the Great Bible depicts God blessing the King, who is handing out copies of the Bible to Thomas Cranmer and Thomas Cromwell. This artwork is generally attributed to Hans Holbein. Coverdale later revised the Great Bible, which was reissued with a preface by Thomas Cranmer in 1540. This version has been known as &#8220;Cranmer&apos;s Bible.&#8221; The Great Bible is also known as the &#8220;Treacle Bible,&#8221; due to Coverdale&apos;s distinctive rendering of Jer 8:22, in which he mentions &#8220;treacle in Gilead&#8221; instead of &#8220;balm in Gilead.&#8221; The Great Bible influenced the Geneva Bible (1560) and the Bishops&apos; Bible (1568). The Convocation of 1571 ordered the Bishops&apos; Bible to be used in all the churches of England. The Psalter of the Great Bible became the Psalter of the 1549 Prayer Book. Coverdale&apos;s Psalter in the Great Bible has been carefully preserved in subsequent Prayer Book revisions, including the 1979 BCP, although some archaic words and inaccurate renderings have been changed.",

        "The feast of Easter is a season of fifty days, from Easter Eve through the Day of Pentecost. From early times the Greek word pentecost (fiftieth day) was used also for the whole Paschal season. During this season there is no fasting. The Council of Nicaea (325) directed that Christians are to pray standing. The word &#8220;alleluia&#8221; (praise the Lord) is said or sung repeatedly, which contrasts sharply with the season of Lent when the alleluia is omitted. The color of liturgical vestments and hangings is white or gold. The BCP notes that it is customary for the Paschal candle to burn at all services of the Easter season. The &#8220;Alleluia, alleluia&#8221; may be added to the dismissals and their responses during the Great Fifty Days. The traditional Christian Easter greeting (see Lk 24:34) serves as the opening acclamation at the eucharist during the Easter season. See Easter.",

        "Great Litany, The",
        "An intercessory prayer including various petitions that are said or sung by the leader, with fixed responses by the congregation. It was used as early as the fifth century in Rome. It was led by a deacon, with the collects led by a bishop or priest. The Litany was the first English language rite prepared by Archbishop Thomas Cranmer. It was first published in 1544. Cranmer modified an earlier litany form by consolidating certain groups of petitions into single prayers with response. The Litany&#8217;s use in church processions was ordered by Henry VIII when England was at war with Scotland and France. It was printed as an appendix to the eucharist in the 1549 BCP. The Litany was used in each of the three ordination rites of the 1550 ordinal, with a special petition and concluding collect. The 1552 BCP called for use of the Litany after the fixed collects of Morning Prayer on Sundays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. The 1928 BCP allowed the Litany to be used after the fixed collects of Morning or Evening Prayer, or before the Eucharist, or separately. The 1928 BCP included a short Litany for Ordinations as an alternative to the Litany. The 1979 BCP titled the Litany &#8220;The Great Litany&#8221; (p. 148), distinguishing it from other litanies in the Prayer Book.The Great Litany may be said or sung. The officiant and people may kneel or stand, or it may be done in procession. The Great Litany may be done before the Eucharist, or after the collects of Morning or Evening Prayer, or separately. Because of its penitential tone, it is especially appropriate during Lent. The Great Litany includes an invocation of the Trinity; a series of deprecations which seek deliverance from evil, spiritual harm, and natural calamities; a series of obsecrations which plead the power of Christ&#8217;s Incarnation, life, death, and resurrection for deliverance; prayers of general intercession; the Agnus Dei; the Kyrie; the Lord&#8217;s Prayer; a versicle and response based on Ps 33:22; a concluding collect; and the grace (BCP, pp.148-154). The Supplication (BCP, p. 154) may be used at the conclusion of the Great Litany, taking the place of all that follows the Lord&#8217;s Prayer.When the Great Litany precedes the eucharist, the Litany concludes with the Kyrie and the eucharist begins with the salutation and the collect of the day (BCP, p. 153). The Great Litany should not be preceded by a hymn, psalm, or anthem when it is used as an entrance rite at the eucharist. The Great Litany takes the place of the prayers of the people at the eucharist. The confession may also be omitted.The Great Litany is also especially appropriate on Rogation Days. The BOS order for a Rogation Procession calls for the Great Litany to begin as the procession enters the church. It adds petitions for favorable weather, productive lands and waters, and God&#8217;s favor for all who care for the earth, the water, and the air. The Great Litany may also conclude the BOS Service for New Year&#8217;s Eve.",

        "Antiphons sung before and after the Magnificat at vespers on the seven days before Christmas. The texts are of unknown origin and date at least from the ninth century. Each antiphon begins with the letter &#8220;O&#8221; and a name or attribute of God from the Hebrew Scriptures: O Sapientia, &#8220;O Wisdom&#8221;; O Adonai, &#8220;O Sacred Lord&#8221;; O Radix Jesse, &#8220;O Root of Jesse&#8221;; O Clavis David, &#8220;O Key of David&#8221;; O Oriens, &#8220;O Rising Sun&#8221;; O Rex gentium, &#8220;O King of nations&#8221;; and O Emmanuel, &#8220;O Emmanuel.&#8221; In the Roman rite the antiphons are sung from Dec. 17-23, but in the medieval Sarum use they began on Dec. 16, adding on Dec. 23, O Virgo virginum (O Virgin of virgins). The Great O Antiphons have been adapted as a popular Advent hymn, &#8220;O come, O come, Emmanuel&#8221; (Hymn 56), whose verses may be used as antiphons for the Magnificat on the appropriate days.",

        "Great Thanksgiving",
        "Title used by the BCP for the eucharistic prayer, the central prayer of the Eucharist. It is also known as the prayer of consecration. It begins with the dialogue called Sursum corda and continues through the Great Amen at the end of its doxology. It gives thanks for creation, redemption, and sanctification. The bread and wine are consecrated in the context of giving thanks over them in the eucharistic prayer. The institution narrative, oblation (anamnesis), invocation of the Holy Spirit (epiclesis), intercessions, and the angelic hymn Sanctus are included in the eucharistic prayers of Rite 1 and Rite 2.Eucharistia is Greek for &#8220;thanksgiving,&#8221; and the Great Thanksgiving distinguishes the thanksgiving over the bread and wine from other thanksgivings, such as that over the baptismal font or the chrism. This ancient title was restored in Prayer Book Studies 19 and succeeding trial rites leading up to the 1979 BCP. The Greeks call this prayer anaphora (offering), and the traditional Latin title is Prex (Prayer). Canon is not a generic name for the eucharistic prayer, but the proper name of the canon Romanus, also called the canon missae, or canon actionis, the present Eucharistic Prayer 1 of the Roman Sacramentary. It was so called because, unlike the eucharistic prayers of other rites, it was always the same, an inflexible rule, or canon. The eucharistic prayer had no title in the 1549 BCP. The Scottish Prayer Book of 1637 introduced the title &#8220;Prayer of Consecration,&#8221; which was used through the 1967 Liturgy of the Lord&apos;s Supper. This focuses on the consecration of the bread and wine but neglects the wider eucharistic aspects of the prayer.",

Students and faculty worshiped together twice a day, and at the turn of the century a large gothic-style chapel was erected at the heart of the campus. Peabody considered Groton a family. He and his wife said good night to students daily with a handshake. He served as headmaster until 1940. The school&apos;s bylaws stated that the headmaster must be an ordained Episcopalian. John Crocker, an Episcopal priest, was headmaster between 1940 and 1965.

In this treatise Hakluyt presented the spiritual and temporal reasons for colonization in America. He noted the potential of colonization for missions and the expansion of Protestantism against Roman Catholicism. He also observed that colonization could shift attention from ecclesiastical problems in England at the time, encourage trade and investments, and provide jobs and training for sailors as well as a place for sending criminals and rebels.

The story was a favorite theme for English mystery plays and art in the middle ages. Christ was portrayed as conquering Satan, and then victoriously leading out Adam and Eve, the prophets, and the patriarchs. The gates of hell cannot withstand Christ&apos;s power. Christ&apos;s victory was expressed in terms of words from Ps 24, &#8220;Lift up your heads, O gates; lift them high, O everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.&#8221; This language dramatizes the power of Christ&apos;s resurrection and shows Christ&apos;s ultimate victory over death.

        "Heaven",
        "Eternal life in our enjoyment of God (BCP, p. 862). The unending fulfillment of salvation and happiness in relationship with God. Heaven has been equated with the beatific vision, and described in terms of perfect bliss and union with God. Many Christians emphasize heaven as a state of completed and eternal relationship with God, rather than a &quot;place.&quot; However, belief in heaven in terms of a place beyond known spatial limits is important in light of belief in the resurrection of the body. God is certainly not contained by any place. The term &quot;heaven&quot; or &quot;the heavens&quot; has been applied to the sky, outer space, and the place where God lives with the angels and those who share God&#039;s life. Although heaven is not understood to be &quot;up&quot; in spatial terms, scripture records that Jesus looked up to heaven when he blessed and broke the bread to feed the five thousand (Mk 6:41), and that Jesus &quot;was carried up into heaven&quot; at the Ascension (Lk 24:51). The Book of Revelation provides a vision of the glory of God in heaven. A vivid and detailed poetic description of heaven is provided by Dante Alighieri&#039;s Divine Comedy. Christian worship includes many expressions of faith concerning heaven. The Lord&#039;s Prayer is addressed to &quot;Our Father in heaven,&quot; and prays for God&#039;s will to be done &quot;on earth as in heaven&quot; (BCP, p. 364). The Nicene Creed affirms that Jesus Christ &quot;came down from heaven&quot; for our salvation (BCP, p. 358). The Apostles&#039; Creed and the Nicene Creed affirm that Jesus &quot;rose again&quot; on the third day after his death, and that he ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father (BCP, pp. 96, 358). The Sanctus in the eucharistic prayer, based on Is 6:3, proclaims that heaven and earth are full of God&#039;s glory (BCP, p. 362). We are to share the joy of heaven with God. Collect 8 from the prayers of the people states that God by the Holy Spirit has made us one with the saints in heaven and on earth (BCP, p. 395). The first of the additional prayers from the Burial of the Dead states that the spirits of those who die in the Lord still live with God, and that the &quot;souls of the faithful are in joy and felicity&quot; with God (BCP, p. 503). The liturgy expresses Christian belief that heaven is not just a remote place, but a relationship of love with God that can be known in daily life and especially in the church. The postcommunion prayer at the Burial of the Dead thanks God for having &quot;given us a foretaste of your heavenly banquet&quot; (BCP, p. 498). Similarly, one of the sentences of administration for the Eucharist is &quot;The Body of Christ, the bread of heaven&quot; (BCP, p. 365). As we can know (at least in part) the heavenly joy of God&#039;s love in the present moment, we can also anticipate the eternal perfection of sharing God&#039;s love which is yet to come.",

        "Hell",
        "Eternal death in our rejection of God (BCP, p. 862). This state or place of separation from God is closely related to the concept of human free will. We may choose to accept or reject God. We will not be forced by God to receive God&#039;s love. Hell is a permanent state of separation from God that can be freely chosen, not God&#039;s angry punishment for misdeeds. The concept of hell can be traced to the OT belief that the dead continued to live a shadowy life in a nether region of darkness and silence known as Sheol. However, it was not a place of torment or retribution. In later Judaism, at the end of the OT period, concepts of final judgment and retribution led to belief that the righteous were separated from the unrighteous in Sheol. Belief in Gehenna, a blazing hell of punishment, likely reflects the influence of Iranian ideas of punitive judgment by God for the wicked. In the NT and Apocrypha, Hades is mentioned as the place of all the dead (Lk 10:15; Acts 2:31; Rv 20:13; Bar 2:17). Gehenna, the &quot;hell of fire,&quot; is where the wicked are punished (Mt 5:22, 10:28, 18:9; Mk 9:43; Lk 12:5; 2 Esd 2:29). NT concepts of hell reflect the darkness of Sheol (Mt 8:12, 22:13, 25:30), and the fire of Gehenna (Mt 3:12; Mk 9:43; Lk 3:17; Rv 20:14-15). Vivid poetic descriptions of hell are provided by Dante Alighieri&#039;s Divine Comedy and John Milton&#039;s Paradise Lost. Jesus foretold the coming judgment in which the Son of Man will come in glory and separate the righteous from the unrighteous as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. The Son of Man will send the unrighteous to eternal punishment and the righteous to eternal life (Mt 25:31-46). In the parable of the talents, the Master commands that the &quot;worthless&quot; servant who buried his talent is to be thrown into the outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth (Mt 25:14-30). The traditional language version of the Apostles&#039; Creed affirms that Jesus &quot;descended into hell,&quot; and the contemporary version states that Jesus &quot;descended to the dead&quot; (BCP, pp. 53, 96). Canticle 14, A Song Of Penitence, based on The Prayer of Manasseh, prays that God will &quot;not let me perish in my sin, nor condemn me to the depths of the earth&quot; (BCP, pp. 90-91). Belief in the reality of hell or the pain of separation from God should never lead to despair that God&#039;s mercy is measured or limited. God&#039;s mercy and power to save exceed our understanding. See Harrowing of Hell.",

Heraldry has also been applied to the seals and coats-of-arms of religious organizations. In 1307 religious houses in England were ordered to have a common seal. The miter, the crozier, and the ecclesiastical hat appeared as emblems in the fourteenth century. Ecclesiastical heraldry is visible today in the seals of many dioceses. It is interesting to note that the seal of some dioceses has a cartouche or oval design, while other dioceses employ a shield design for the seal. The shield is a military symbol, and its appropriateness for use as a diocesan symbol may be questioned. Many diocesan seals include a cross, or other religious symbols. Some diocesan seals incorporate one or more symbols that are associated with the location of the diocese. For example, the seal of the Diocese of Milwaukee displays a badger, which is associated with Wisconsin, &quot;the badger state.&quot; Some parishes and other church organizations also have seals.",

He was public orator at Cambridge in 1620. This position could have led to high public office. However, he subsequently studied divinity and was ordained priest in 1630. His turning away from a secular career followed the death of James I, who had shown him favor. His new direction in life may also have reflected the influence of his friend, Nicholas Ferrar, the founder of the religious community at Little Gidding. Herbert ended his days as priest at Bemberton (1630-1633), outside Salisbury, England. He was devoted to his parish work and came to be known as the &quot;holy Mr. Herbert.&quot; Herbert&#039;s poems reflect a faith that is heartfelt, passionate, and expressed with grace. His collection of poems, The Temple (1633), includes his most beloved poems such as &quot;Prayer,&quot; &quot;Love III,&quot; &quot;The Altar,&quot; and &quot;Easter Wings&quot; in the section called &quot;The Church.&quot; Several of Herbert&#039;s poems have been set to music and are included in The Hymnal 1982, including &quot;King of glory, King of peace&quot; (382), &quot;Let all the world in every corner sing&quot; (402-403), and &quot;Come, my Way, my Truth, my Life&quot; (487). Shortly before his death, Herbert sent his English poems to Ferrar to be published or burned. Herbert&#039;s best known prose work is A Priest to the Temple; or the Country Parson (1652). His life is commemorated in the Episcopal calendar of the church year on Feb. 27. Herbert&#039;s mother, Lady Herbert, was John Donne&#039;s patron.",

Bucer began work on a church order based largely on the 1533 Brandenburg-Nuremberg Order of Andreas Osiander and Johann Brenz. Philipp Melancthon, brought to Cologne in May 1543, revised and enlarged the doctrinal portion. The order, adopted in July, was published in October. A slightly revised German version was published in Nov. 1544. An amended Latin version was published in 1545. An English translation of the Latin version, A Simple, and Religious Consultation , was published in London on Oct. 30, 1547, and an amended edition was published in 1548. Various sections were printed separately. The 1549 BCP is indebted to this book in its calendar and in almost every rite.

A eucharist in which the celebrant is assisted by a deacon and a layperson serving as a liturgical subdeacon may be known as a Solemn Eucharist. The contrasting low mass is characterized by its requirements of a single minister (a priest-celebrant) and a strictly restrained ceremonial. The high mass was recognized as the eucharistic norm in the Roman rites of the middle ages, although the low mass was by far the more common celebration. The eucharistic rite in the 1549 BCP drew on a style similar to the normative high mass. But the 1552 BCP, alert to popular sensibilities favoring the more familiar low mass, used that style as the basis for its communion service. Subsequent Prayer Books followed the pattern of the 1552 BCP, which presupposed the priest-celebrant as the single liturgical leader at the eucharist. This tendency was somewhat reversed by the 1979 BCP, which calls for a variety of ministers-ordained and lay-in roles of liturgical leadership at the eucharist.",

Around 353 he was consecrated Bishop of Poitiers and spent most of his episcopal life fighting the Arians and defending the great Nicene theologian, Athanasius. Hilary also promoted the work of Martin of Tours, who introduced monasticism into Gaul. His most significant writing was De Trinitate (On the Trinity), the first extensive study of this doctrine in the west, which was written against the Arians. Jerome called him &#8220;the trumpet of the Latins against the Arians,&#8221; and he also was called &#8220;the Athanasius of the West.&#8221; In 1851 Pope Pius IX named him a Doctor of the Church.

        "Hippolytus",
        "(c. 170-c. 236). Theologian of the Roman Church, presbyter, antipope, and martyr. Hippolytus strongly resisted Popes Zephyrinus, Callistus, Urban, and Pontianus. Hippolytus was zealous for orthodoxy and a rigorist concerning penitential discipline. He wanted a church of the pure. He accused Callistus of heresy and laxity. Hippolytus was apparently made antipope of a schismatic Christian community in Rome when Callistus was Pope. Hippolytus&#039;s schism continued under Callistus&#039;s successors Urban and Pontianus. Hippolytus and Pontianus were both exiled to Sardinia during the persecution of Emperor Maximinus Thrax. Hippolytus and Pontianus apparently reconciled before they died. Pope Fabian brought both bodies back to Rome for burial on the same day, Aug. 13. Although Hippolytus is not included in the Episcopal calendar of the church year, his feast day has traditionally been celebrated on Aug. 13 in the western church and on Jan. 30 in the eastern church. Hippolytus has been described as the most important third-century Roman theologian. He was the last significant Roman theologian to write in Greek. He wrote at a time when Greek was not generally understood by the Christian community in Rome. His Philosophumena, or Refutation of all Heresies, was recovered and published in 1851. Hippolytus believed that all heresies were derived from ancient philosophies. Hippolytus wrote exegetical treatises and the Commentary on Daniel. One of Hippolytus&#039;s best known works is the Apostolic Tradition. It was written about 215 in Rome. It was one of the earliest church orders, which provided norms for church life including the liturgy. The Apostolic Tradition has detailed information concerning the rites and practices of the church in Rome in the early third century, including descriptions of Baptism, Eucharist, and the Easter Vigil. Hippolytus&#039;s Apostolic Tradition continues to be highly valued and influential in contemporary liturgical studies. It is frequently cited in Marion J. Hatchett&#039;s Commentary on the American Prayer Book (1980). See Church Orders.",

        "Historic Episcopate",
        "The succession of bishops in the history of the church from the apostles until the present. During the colonial period there were several efforts to bring the historic episcopate to America, but none succeeded. Samuel Seabury went to England in 1783 to receive the historic episcopate. It proved impossible for Seabury to be ordained and consecrated a bishop in England because English law required all ordinands to swear an oath of loyalty to the English sovereign. Seabury was ordained and consecrated into the historic episcopate by nonjuring bishops of the Episcopal Church in Scotland on Nov. 14, 1784. On June 26, 1786, Parliament passed an act which granted the Archbishop of Canterbury the right to consecrate three bishops who would not be required to take the oath of loyalty to the sovereign. William White and Samuel Provoost were consecrated Bishops of Pennsylvania and New York, respectively, on Feb. 4, 1787, and James Madison was consecrated Bishop of Virginia on Sept. 19, 1790. On Sept. 17, 1792, Thomas Claggett was consecrated Bishop of Maryland by Bishop Provoost, assisted by Bishops Seabury, White, and Madison. This combined the lines of succession of the historic episcopate in the Episcopal Church. The fourth point of the Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral states that one of the &#8220;inherent parts&#8221; of the sacred deposit of the Christian faith is &#8220;The Historic Episcopate, locally adapted in the methods of its administration to the varying needs of the nations and peoples called of God into the Unity of His Church&#8221; (BCP, pp. 876-878).",

        "This term refers to the kind of scriptural interpretation which developed after the study of the texts or manuscripts of these writings. It is clear that we do not have any of the original documents, merely copies of copies. Because questions were raised about their validity, scholars began to question the significance of the different gospels and other biblical stories. The historical approach was an attempt to understand each writing in its historical context. Historical criticism seeks to explain the difference between various scriptural passages in terms of the different times of writing, the different locations of the authors, and the way earlier writings were used by later authors. If the specific details of a writing are primarily determined by its time, place, author, and situation, it is easier to understand its distinctiveness using these historical contexts. This approach also makes it easier for us to find a significant understanding for our time and place. We should analyze the text not primarily on the basis of timeless ideas or themes but in light of the cultural context of the author and the intended audience. We need to learn as much as possible about the other writings, philosophy, and language-usage of the time in which the text was created to discover its basic meaning.",

        "Discipline which deals with the methods of writing history and with the techniques of historical investigation. Historiography seeks to reconstruct an accurate record of human activities and to achieve a deeper understanding of them. Until the nineteenth century, the interpretation of human life as a whole was more properly the function of the theologian, the philosopher, or the poet. Historiographical traditions developed slowly in the ancient world. In Greece and Rome the writing of history was a branch of literature. The most appreciated historians were those who, like Thucydides, touched on universal problems or, like Tacitus, wrote in a dramatic way about important events. Their works were judged more on their stylistic methods than on their accuracy. Christian historiography in medieval Europe emphasized divine influence in human affairs. The fascination with pagan antiquity which characterized the Renaissance led to the development of philological studies and textual criticism, a renewed emphasis on style, and a gradual awareness of the process of historical change, along with a desire to recapture the rational causes of events. With the Reformation, the starting point for a Protestant rewriting of history was the idea that the &quot;true Church&quot; always existed. The &quot;true Church&quot; was understood to have been at times overshadowed by the enemies of the divine order, including the upholders of papal authority as well as pagans and heretics. Historians writing in this tradition were uninterested in objectivity, but they gathered masses of documentary sources to support their arguments. The Enlightenment introduced new impulses in historiography: a sense of the unity of human history, including an interest in continents outside Europe; a capacity for bold generalizations about the important features of particular periods or societies; and a preference for topics connected with the progress of human civilization. In the nineteenth century historiography emerged as a distinct discipline. It was practiced mainly by professional academicians.",

The design called for the pulpit to be placed against the east wall. The holy table was in front of the pulpit, and the baptismal font was nearby, all within the altar rails. All three liturgical centers were before the people throughout the rites. The term is something of a misnomer. The arrangement was also favored by leading evangelicals, and it can be traced to late eighteenth-century churches in England, Scotland, and Ireland, and even earlier German Lutheran churches. New churches were built in America, and old churches were renovated to conform to this design. Several examples still exist.

His last parish was St. Mark&apos;s Church, Philadelphia, where he was rector from 1869 until 1879. Hoffman was dean of General Seminary from June 15, 1879, until his death. Hoffman is remembered as General Seminary&apos;s &#8220;most munificent benefactor,&#8221; and under him most of its present quadrangle and grounds, buildings, professorships, endowments, and customs were established. The deanship and the chairs of pastoral theology, NT, and dogmatic theology all received their endowments from him or his family. The seminary&apos;s Gutenberg Bible, sold by the trustees at public auction in 1978, was the gift of Dean Hoffman. The Chapel of the Good Shepherd, completed 1885-1888 in English collegiate gothic with a 161-foot bell tower, is a gift of Hoffman&apos;s mother in memory of her husband. Hoffman made the chapel the vital center of the seminary&apos;s life. Under his leadership the vested faculty evensong procession was instituted, as well as the wearing of academic gowns by students and faculty. He also established the custom of conferring the honorary doctorate upon graduates of the seminary who became bishops. Hoffman was a high churchman, an avid collector of rare books, chairman of the building committee for the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, and president of the New York Historical Society.

        "Holy Cross Day",
        "A major feast observed on Sept. 14 in honor of Christ&#039;s self-offering on the cross for our salvation. The collect for Holy Cross Day recalls that Christ &quot;was lifted high upon the cross that he might draw the whole world unto himself,&quot; and prays that &quot;we, who glory in the mystery of our redemption, may have grace to take up our cross and follow him&quot; (BCP, p. 192). The themes of Holy Cross Day are powerfully expressed by the hymn &quot;Lift high the cross&quot; (Hymn 473). This feast is known as &quot;The Exaltation of the Holy Cross&quot; in the eastern church and in missals and sacramentaries of the western church, and it is known as &quot;The Triumph of the Cross&quot; in the Roman Catholic Church. It was one of the 12 great feasts in the Byzantine liturgy. The 1979 BCP is the first American Prayer Book to include Holy Cross Day. Historically, the feast has been associated with the dedication on Sept. 14, 335, of a complex of buildings built by the Emperor Constantine (c. 285-337) in Jerusalem on the sites of the crucifixion and Christ&#039;s tomb. This shrine included a large basilica and a circular church. Constantine&#039;s mother, Helena (c. 255- c. 330), supervised the construction of the shrine, and a relic believed to be the cross was discovered during the work of excavation. Claims by the Church of Jerusalem to have the cross date from the mid-fourth century, and the pilgrim Egeria mentions a feast commemorating the discovery of the cross in Jerusalem in the late-fourth-century. This feast has also been associated with the exposition at Jerusalem of the cross by the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius (575-641). He recovered the relic from the Persians who took it from Jerusalem in 614 when they destroyed the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Although the authenticity of alleged relics of the cross may be questionable, Holy Cross Day provides an opportunity for a joyous celebration of Christ&#039;s redeeming death on a cross.

They had &#8220;observed his star at its rising,&#8221; and came to pay him homage. They told this to Herod, which frightened him &#8220;and all Jerusalem with him.&#8221; Herod feared that the young &#8220;king&#8221; would threaten his throne. The chief priests and scribes told Herod that the Messiah was to be born in Bethlehem. They also told him when the star had appeared. Herod told the wise men to search diligently for the child in Bethlehem and tell him when they found the child. He said he wanted to go to the child and pay him homage. The wise men found the child Jesus and offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. But the wise men were warned in a dream not to return to Herod, and &#8220;they left for their own country by another road.&#8221; Herod was furious when he realized that he had been tricked by the wise men. He ordered the death of all male children in and around Bethlehem who were two years old and under. The child Jesus was not harmed because Joseph had been warned in a dream to escape to Egypt with Jesus and Mary. The feast of the Holy Innocents has been dated from the fourth century in Bethlehem and from the fifth century in North Africa and Rome. It is a major feast of the Episcopal calendar of the church year, observed on Dec. 28. The collect for this feast prays that God will receive &#8220;into the arms of your mercy all innocent victims; and by your great might frustrate the designs of evil tyrants and establish your rule of justice, love, and peace&#8221; (BCP, p. 238).

        "Holy Name of Our Lord Jesus Christ, The",
        "Celebration on Jan. 1, the eighth day after the birth of Jesus, when he was named and circumcised. He was &quot;called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb&quot; (Lk 2:21). Under the Law of Moses, all male infants were to be circumcised on the eighth day after birth (Lv 12:3). It was also customary at this time for family and friends to witness the naming of the child. This major feast is celebrated on Jan. 1, the eighth day of the Christmas season. The designation of the feast in honor of Jesus&#039; Holy Name is new to the 1979 BCP. It was traditionally celebrated as the Feast of the Circumcision. Celebration of the Holy Name reflects the significance of the Holy Name of Jesus, and the emphasis of the Gospel of Luke on the naming of Jesus rather than his circumcision. Liturgical celebration of Jesus&#039; circumcision began in the Gallican Church. The Council of Tours (567) called for Jan. 1 to be observed as a fast day to counter pagan celebrations of the beginning of the new year. This day was also traditionally associated with devotion to the Virgin Mary. Celebration of the Feast of the Name of Jesus dates from the end of the middle ages. In the fifteenth century, the Franciscans Bernardino of Siena (1380-1444) and Giovanni Capistrano (1386-1456) encouraged devotion to the name of Jesus. This celebration was officially granted to the Franciscans in 1530 for observance on Jan. 14. In 1721 Innocent XIII called for the whole Roman Catholic Church to observe the feast on the Second Sunday after Epiphany. This feast was introduced into England in 1489 and celebrated on Aug. 7. It was included as a black letter day in the Elizabethan Calendar of the church year in 1561. The name &quot;Jesus&quot; is from the Hebrew Joshua, or Yehoshuah, &quot;Yahweh is salvation&quot; or &quot;Yahweh will save.&quot; Devotion to the Holy Name of Jesus is particularly derived from Phil 2:9-11, which states that God highly exalted Jesus &quot;and gave him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven and on earth and under the earth.&quot; This scriptural devotion is paraphrased by the hymn &quot;At the name of Jesus&quot; (Hymn 435) in The Hymnal 1982. Other hymns that express devotion to the Holy Name of Jesus include &quot;To the name of our salvation&quot; (Hymns 248-249) and &quot;Jesus! Name of wondrous love!&quot; (Hymn 252).",

In the NT, Jesus is called the Christ because he is the one anointed by the Spirit. The gift of the Spirit to Jesus&apos; disciples after the crucifixion is associated with the post-resurrection appearances of Jesus in Jn 20:19-23 and with the Day of Pentecost in Acts 2. The Catechism states that the church is holy &#8220;because the Holy Spirit dwells in it, consecrates its members, and guides them to do God&apos;s will&#8221; (BCP, p. 854). The Council of Constantinople in 381 stated that the Holy Spirit is as truly God as the Son, both being of &#8220;one substance&#8221; with the Father. The Nicene Creed states belief &#8220;in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son. With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified. He has spoken through the prophets&#8221; (BCP, p. 359). In the relations of the persons of the Trinity, the Spirit is said to proceed from the Father by the mode of &#8220;spiration&#8221; or &#8220;breathing,&#8221; while the Son is said to proceed from the Father by the mode of &#8220;generation.&#8221; Western theology came to speak of the Spirit proceeding &#8220;from the Father and the Son.&#8221; The Episcopal theologian William Porcher DuBose stated in The Soteriology of the New Testament (1892) that &#8220;all God&apos;s operations in us as spiritual beings are by the word through the spirit&#8221; (p. 56). Pneumatology is the theological study of the Holy Spirit. The Hymnal 1982 provides a section of hymns on the Holy Spirit (Hymns 500-516), including &#8220;Come, Holy Ghost, our souls inspire&#8221; (Hymns 503-504) and &#8220;Breathe on me, Breath of God&#8221; (Hymn 508).

It is especially appropriate to sprinkle the congregation with holy water at the Renewal of Baptismal Vows at the Easter Vigil (BCP, p. 292) and at other times of renewal of the baptismal covenant. The asperges is the ceremony of sprinkling holy water over the altar, clergy, and people before the eucharist. Some parishes use a stoup, basin, or font to make holy water available to those who enter the church. Those who wish to participate in the pious custom of &#8220;taking holy water&#8221; may touch it with the fingers, placing a drop of it on the forehead while making the sign of the cross on the forehead, chest, and shoulders. The early origin of this custom is evidenced by the presence of stoups for holy water in ancient basilicas. Holy water has been known as &#8220;lustral water,&#8221; reflecting its symbolic role in purification.

As the pilgrim Egeria recorded in the late fourth century, Jerusalem contained many sacred places that were sites for devotion and liturgy. Numerous pilgrims to the holy city followed the path of Jesus in his last days. They formed processions, worshipped where Christ suffered and died, and venerated relics. From this beginning evolved the rites we observe today on Palm Sunday, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Holy Saturday. These services provide a liturgical experience of the last days of Jesus&apos; earthly life, as well as the time and events leading up to his resurrection. The BCP provides special liturgies for each of these days. The eucharistic lectionary also provides proper readings for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday in Holy Week. Some parishes observe the service of Tenebrae on one of these days in Holy Week. In many dioceses, the diocesan clergy will make a reaffirmation of ordination vows in the context of a eucharist during Holy Week, usually before Maundy Thursday. The three holy days, or Triduum, of Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Holy Saturday are at the heart of the Holy Week observance. In many Episcopal parishes, the liturgical color for Holy Week from Palm Sunday through Maundy Thursday is red.

Arius understood Father and Son to be of similar-but not identical-being or essence. Although Father and Son were considered to be in some sense similar, they were also considered in some sense dissimilar. Arius regarded the Son or Word to be a created being, as a boat is created by a shipbuilder. For Arius, Father and Son could not be said to be of one substance. The Council of Nicaea in 325 declared such an understanding of the relationship between Father and Son to be inadequate to provide for the divine salvation of the world through the Son.

After lengthy debate at the Council of Nicaea in 325, homoousios became the approved, orthodox way to express the relationship between the first and second persons of the Trinity. This understanding contradicted Arius, who conceived the Word to be a creature of God, similar but in some respects unlike the first person of the Godhead (homoiousios).

He received his B.A. in 1574 and his M.A. in 1577. In 1577 he was chosen fellow of his college. In 1579 he was named reader in Hebrew for the University. He was ordained deacon in 1582, and priest in the same year. On Mar. 17, 1585, Hooker was appointed Master of the Temple in London. He encountered Walter Travers, a leading Calvinist Puritan, at the Temple. Thomas Fuller said, &quot;the pulpit spake pure Canterbury in the morning and Geneva in the afternoon until Travers was silenced.&quot; In 1591 Hooker left the Temple and became the rector at Boscombe in Wiltshire. In July, 1595, he became rector of Bishopsbourne in Kent, where he died. Hooker&#039;s major contribution was his monumental Of the Lawes of Ecclesiastical Polity. The first four books of the Lawes were published in 1594, the fifth book was published in 1597, and the last three books were published much later after his death. With the Lawes, Hooker became the great apologist of the Elizabethan Settlement. In the Lawes he created both a distinctive philosophy of constitutional government and an Anglican theology that remains congenial to modern thought. He provided the classical Anglican answer to the Puritan criticisms of episcopacy and the Prayer Book. Hooker affirmed the threefold Anglican sources of authority-scripture, tradition, and reason. He countered the Roman Catholic argument which treated the Bible and tradition as equally authoritative for belief. He also countered the Puritans whose literal obedience to scripture was so absolute that they considered unlawful whatever scripture did not command. He recognized the absolute authority of scripture where it spoke plainly. Reason was to be used in reading scripture. If scripture were silent or ambiguous, wisdom would consult the tradition of the church. On this foundation Hooker built an elaborate theory based on the &quot;absolute fundamental of natural law,&quot; the expression of God&#039;s supreme wisdom which governs the universe and to which both ecclesiastical and civil polity must yield. Hooker saw the church not as a static but as an organic institution whose methods of government change according to circumstances. He understood the Church of England, though reformed, to be in continuity with historic Christianity. He is commemorated in the Episcopal calendar of the church year on Nov. 3.",

        "(Jan. 30, 1792-Jan. 9, 1868). Eighth Presiding Bishop. He was born in Dublin, Ireland, and came to the United States in 1800. Educated privately, he began work in 1813 as a superintendent of ironworks near Pittsburgh. Although not yet ordained, he was called in 1823 as rector of Calvary Church, Pittsburgh, where he was temporary organist. He was ordained deacon on Dec. 14, 1823, and priest on May 12, 1824. Hopkins became assistant minister at Trinity Church, Boston, in 1831, and was elected the first Bishop of Vermont. He served as bishop from his consecration on Oct. 31, 1832, until his death. He served as Presiding Bishop from Jan. 13, 1865, until he died. Hopkins was a prolific writer and controversialist. In Slavery: Its Religious Sanction (1851) he argued that slavery had a divine warrant. After the Civil War, Hopkins as Presiding Bishop welcomed the return of the southern dioceses and helped to end the division that was caused by the war. The Law of Ritualism (1866) was influential in the eventual acceptance in most Episcopal parishes of such liturgical customs as eucharistic vestments and altar candles. He died in Burlington.",

He was born in Boston, Massachusetts. Huntington received his B.A. from Harvard in 1875. He studied at St. Andrew&apos;s Divinity School, Syracuse, 1876-1879. He was ordained deacon on Sept. 21, 1878, and priest on May 30, 1880.

On Nov. 1, 1881, Huntington, Robert Stockton Dod, and James Gibbon Cameron began to live the religious life together. On Nov. 25, 1884, at the Chapel of the Sisters of St. John the Baptist, New York City, Huntington made his life profession as the first monk in the Order of the Holy Cross. Henry Codman Potter, Assistant Bishop of New York, received Huntington&apos;s vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. Huntington was superior of the order, 1884-1888, 1897-1907, 1915-1918, and 1921-1930. Huntington was a social reformer who worked to improve the lives of his poor parishioners. As a ritualist priest he brought beauty into the lives of those who lived in drab environments. His most radical activity was to support the single tax advocated by Henry George. This was a single tax on unearned increment (increased value) of real property, which would have been the only tax. He was also the author of several books.

He received his A.B. from Harvard in 1859. He studied for the ordained ministry of the Episcopal Church under the direction of Frederic Dan Huntington, who was later Bishop of Central New York. He was ordained deacon on Oct. 1, 1861, and priest on Dec. 3, 1862. He was rector of All Saints Church, Worcester, Massachusetts, 1862-1883; and rector of Grace Church, New York City, 1883-1909. Huntington was a member of the House of Deputies of the General Convention, 1871-1907. In <em>The Church Idea</em> (1870), Huntington presented the Anglican basis for an ecumenical &quot;Church of the Reconciliation&quot; in America in terms of acceptance of the Holy Scriptures as the Word of God; the Nicene Creed as the rule of faith; Baptism and Eucharist, the two sacraments ordained by Christ; and the episcopate as the keystone of church unity. This &quot;foursquare&quot; basis for church unity came to be known as the &quot;Quadrilateral.&quot; Huntington&#039;s efforts led to the adoption of the Quadrilateral by the House of Bishops at the 1886 General Convention of the Episcopal Church in Chicago. It was not enacted by the House of Deputies at the 1886 Convention. However, the Quadrilateral was passed in a modified form as a resolution at the Lambeth Conference of 1888. The Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral continues to be the primary Anglican ecumenical statement and standard. Huntington also sought greater flexibility and accessibility in the worship of the Episcopal Church. He sought to modernize Prayer Book worship in light of the needs of the American people. He called for a complete revision of the BCP at the 1874 General Convention. His Materia Ritualis was the working paper of the joint committee on Prayer Book revision prior to the 1883 General Convention. Huntington was a leader in proposing The Book Annexed to the Report of the Joint Committee (1883), which was a significant revision of the BCP. The Book Annexed was not accepted, but this Prayer Book revision process ultimately resulted in the 1892 BCP. Some of the prayers of The Book Annexed were later incorporated into the worship of the church, such as the prayer For the Poor and Neglected (BCP, p. 826). Huntington also had an important role in the canonical authorization of the order of deaconesses in the Episcopal Church. He died in Nahant, Massachusetts. His life is commemorated in the Episcopal calendar of the church year on July 27. See Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral.",

It is published by Church Publishing Incorporated, formerly Church Hymnal Corporation, a subsidiary of the Church Pension Fund. Hymnals have been authorized for the Episcopal Church by General Convention in 1789, 1826, 1871, 1892, 1916, 1940, and 1982. Only hymn texts were authorized for the first four hymnals. Unauthorized editions of these hymnals with tunes were published privately. The 1916 Hymnal was the first to be published with an authorized musical edition. The music edition was prepared by the Joint Commission on Church Music, with final editing of the volume by Canon Charles Winfred Douglas (1867-1944). It was published in 1918, and also known as the New Hymnal. Profits from its sale were designated to benefit the Church Pension Fund. The Hymnal (1940) drew on a variety of sources for hymn texts in addition to British and American authors. It included a significant representation of texts translated from Latin, Greek, and German, in addition to some representation of texts translated from Dutch, Italian, French, Hebrew, Danish, Irish, Swahili, Syriac, and Welsh. The music edition for The Hymnal (1940) was prepared by the Joint Commission on Church Music, with Douglas as musical editor. It was published in 1943. Prior to the 1982 revision of the Hymnal, the Standing Commission on Church Music adopted a statement of philosophy in 1981 for hymnal revision. This statement agreed that the Hymnal should be a companion for the new 1979 BCP, supporting its changes and areas of emphasis such as the expanded Lectionary, the revised Calendar, and the renewed emphasis on baptism as a public rite; the Hymnal should retain classic texts but also present a prophetic vision, speaking to the church of the future as well as the present; hymn texts should authentically and fully present the church&apos;s teaching, with the Hymnal serving as a practical book of theology for the people of God; the Hymnal should be comprehensive in its coverage of all major historic periods, reflecting and speaking to a variety of cultures and races; hymn texts should use inclusive language whenever possible; obscure language should be clarified for contemporary use; the Hymnal should be ecumenical in nature, although it is prepared for use in the Episcopal Church; the Hymnal should be a practical collection, with keyboard settings that can be used by a performer with average skills; the Hymnal should present various musical possibilities when tunes are used more than once; and the Hymnal should present a variety of musical styles that represent the best expressive artistic creativity of musicians. Music for The Hymnal 1982 was prepared by the Standing Commission on Church Music. This edition was published in 1985. The Hymnal 1982 provides a major section of Service Music for the Daily Office, the Great Litany, Proper Liturgies for Special Days, Baptism, Eucharist, and Canticles; Hymns for the Daily Office, the Church Year, Baptism, Eucharist, Confirmation, Marriage, Burial of the Dead, Ordination, Consecration of a Church, General Hymns (arranged by thematic categories such as &#8220;Praise to God,&#8221; &#8220;Christian Vocation and Pilgrimage,&#8221; and &#8220;The Church Triumphant&#8221;), the Christian Life, Rounds and Canons, and National Songs; along with Indexes for the volume. The Hymnal 1982 includes 720 hymns. Raymond F. Glover served as general editor. The Episcopal tradition of an official hymnal differs from the Church of England, which has never published an authorized collection of hymns.

Icons were painted or placed on the walls of churches and on interior beams and screens. They were also displayed in private houses and at wayside shrines.The oldest extant icons date from the fifth century. The Seventh Ecumenical Council of 787 determined that the use of icons is supported by the Incarnation, in which the Word of God united to created human nature and thus to matter in general. That Council also taught that the honor given to an icon passes to that which it represents. The eastern churches developed the icon tradition extensively. In the west the tradition was eclipsed by the Renaissance and other artistic movements. However, offshoots of the icon tradition in the west include the use of stained glass windows and the illustrations in manuscripts and liturgical books.

        "(c. 35-c. 115). Bishop, patristic theologian, and martyr. Very little is known about the life of Ignatius. He was the second, or possibly third, Bishop of Antioch. He was serving as Bishop of Antioch by the year 100. Ignatius is the most significant of the Apostolic Fathers. He is remembered for his contributions to the development of the episcopate and the threefold orders of deacon, presbyter, and bishop; his contributions to the development of the eucharist; his orthodox defenses against heresies, especially Ebionism and Docetism; and his enthusiastic martyrdom. He is one of the most important figures in the early church, a period when the church was developing from its infant NT roots and moving in the direction of an organized, defined, and catholic religion. Ignatius was the first person to use the term &#8220;Catholic Church&#8221; and the first advocate of episcopacy. More than any other person he stressed the role of a single bishop, or monoepiscopacy. Prior to his time, each church was governed by groups of bishops or elders (presbyters), terms which were virtually synonymous. He insisted that there should be one bishop who presided over presbyters and deacons. Ignatius argued that a strong episcopate was needed for the order and unity of the church, and for the defense and continuity of church doctrine. He was arrested and taken to Rome for execution. On the way he wrote seven letters, which contain much information about the early church. He died in Rome. Ignatius is commemorated in the Episcopal calendar of the church year on Oct. 17.

With six companions he founded the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) in Paris on Aug. 15, 1534, to work for the conversion of heretics. In Nov. 1538 the society placed itself at the service of the Pope. The motto of the society is, &#8220;For the greater glory of God.&#8221; Ignatius has influenced most forms of modern Christian spirituality through the Spiritual Exercises. Ignatius composed this work to guide retreatants through a thirty-day process in which they choose between God and evil. They also learn to meditate on the life of Christ and to imitate him. The society specializes in education in the spirit of the Counter-Reformation, with a generous opening to classical and humanistic studies. Ignatian spirituality has an Incarnational emphasis that seeks &#8220;to find God in all things,&#8221; serving God and humanity. Ignatius died in Rome. He was canonized on May 22, 1622.

        "Mode of baptism in which the candidate&#039;s entire body is introduced into the water. The term &quot;baptize&quot; is from the Greek, &quot;to dip.&quot; Immersion was the normal way of baptism in the early church. Questions concerning the candidate&#039;s belief in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit were answered in the affirmative, and each followed by an immersion of the candidate. Christian creeds developed from these questions and answers at baptism. The candidate&#039;s immersion and emergence from the water of baptism is sharing in Christ&#039;s death and resurrection (Rom 6:1-11, Col 2:12). Scripture also describes baptism as a cleansing bath of spiritual renewal (Eph 5:26, Ti 3:5, Heb 10:22). In the early church, candidates were baptized by immersion in natural or existing sources of water such as rivers, fountains, pools, and the sea. The Didache permits pouring water over the head of the candidate three times in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit if there is insufficient water for immersion. Water and the trinitarian formula are essential for baptism, but there is flexibility concerning the mode and place of baptism. By the third century baptisms were being done in pools or baths in a special room or area of a church known as a baptistery. The shallowness and size of some baptisteries has led some to question whether baptisms involved complete submersions. Immersion has been distinguished from submersion. The evidence of early baptisteries and Christian art has been interpreted to indicate that the candidate stood in a pool of water while water was poured over the candidate&#039;s head. Others have interpreted the architectural evidence of early baptisteries to argue that the candidate bent over to be completely immersed. Patristic writings indicate that the candidate for baptism stood about waist deep in water and was immersed by bowing forward with the celebrant&#039;s hand on the candidate&#039;s head. The Orthodox and some Protestant churches have generally insisted that immersion is required for baptism. Luther favored baptism by immersion to signify the drowning of sin, but he did not insist on immersion. The 1549 BCP called for a threefold immersion and the trinitarian baptismal formula. The celebrant was to dip the child &quot;discreetly and warily.&quot; Infant baptism was typical in the Anglican Church at that time. The 1552 BCP did not require a threefold immersion. The 1979 BCP directs (p. 307) that the celebrant or an assisting priest or deacon shall immerse or pour water upon each candidate and say the trinitarian formula of baptism. In practice, most Episcopal churches baptize by pouring (affusion). However, the renewal of the catechumenate and the Christian formation of adults has been accompanied by appreciation for the symbolic power and appropriateness of baptism by immersion.",

In contrast, the orthodox doctrine of the Incarnation recognized Jesus to be &quot;truly God and truly man . . . in two natures, without confusion, without change, without division, without separation,&quot; as noted by the Council of Chalcedon (451) (BCP, p. 864).",

Incense was widely used in Judaism and other cultures of the ancient world as a means of sacrifice, purification, and veneration. Frankincense or pure incense, the resin of certain trees, was among the gifts brought by the Magi to the young child Christ (Mt 2:11). Despite this scriptural precedent, early Christians avoided incense as a pagan practice connected with sacrifice and emperor worship, and churches did not begin to use it until the fourth century. Thereafter incense was burned at several points in the Daily Office and the Eucharist, and extensively in eastern churches. For Christians today, incense is associated mainly with prayer, as Rv 8:3-4 suggests. Many Anglicans feel free to use it as a sacred symbol and aid to worship. The first option in the BCP for an opening sentence at Evening Prayer is &#8220;Let my prayer be set forth in your sight as incense, the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice&#8221; (Ps 141:2) (BCP, pp. 61, 115). The BCP states that incense may be used during the singing of Phos hilaron in the &#8220;Order of Worship for the Evening&#8221; (p. 143), and during the covering of the altar in the &#8220;Consecration of a Church.&#8221; There are congregations where incense is used at the Easter Vigil and other major feasts, and some parishes use it regularly on Sunday.",

        "Inclusive Language",
        "Spoken and written language that intentionally avoids word use that is needlessly gender-specific or exclusive. Inclusive language also means the use of male and female imagery and metaphors in a balanced way to express the truths we know of God. Inclusive language may challenge the church to discover new depths of meaning and possibility in the words of faith that we use. Traditional English usage referred to God and humanity with male pronouns. A male pronoun was often used &quot;generically&quot; when the pronoun could refer to either a woman or a man. This traditional English usage came to be perceived as demeaning and exclusive of women. It was judged to be offensive by women and men who called for a more inclusive use of language, especially in the life and worship of the church. This call for inclusive language was rooted in the theological understanding that God includes and transcends human masculinity and femininity. God is neither male nor female. Both women and men are equally loved and included by God and should be valued and shown respect in the church&#039;s language. With the exception of Rite 1 services, the 1979 BCP uses inclusive language when speaking of people. For example, one version of the Nicene Creed in the Rite 1 Eucharist affirms that Jesus Christ came down from heaven &quot;for us men and for our salvation&quot; (BCP, p. 328). Although the clear intent is to include all humanity, only men are mentioned in this version of the Nicene Creed. In contrast, the first version of the Nicene Creed in the Rite 1 Eucharist and the Nicene Creed in the Rite 2 Eucharist use more inclusive language to state that Jesus Christ came down from heaven &quot;For us and for our salvation&quot; (BCP, pp. 326, 358). Such use of inclusive language is found in contemporary biblical translation. The Revised Standard Version (1952) renders Jesus&#039; statement recorded in Jn 6:35, &quot;I am the bread of life; he who comes to me shall not hunger, and he who believes in me shall never thirst.&quot; In contrast, the New Revised Standard Version (1989) renders the same statement in more inclusive language, &quot;I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.&quot; Supplemental liturgical texts and materials have been developed with sensitivity for inclusive language. A resolution of the 1985 General Convention called for the Standing Liturgical Commission to prepare inclusive language liturgies for the regular services of the church. This resolution and subsequent legislation by General Convention led to the publication of Liturgical Texts for Evaluation (1987), Prayer Book Studies 30-Supplemental Liturgical Texts (1989), and Supplemental Liturgical Materials (1991). These resources include liturgies for Morning Prayer, Order for Evening, Evening Prayer, and Holy Eucharist, as well as supplemental musical materials for use in these services. The First Supplemental Eucharistic Prayer in Prayer Book Studies 30 prays to God who &quot;remembered us from our beginning and fed us with your constant love,&quot; and &quot;redeemed us in Jesus Christ and knit us into one body.&quot; The Second Supplemental Eucharistic Prayer prays to God who &quot;took us by the hand, and taught us to walk in your ways.&quot; Even though we wandered away, God would not forget us, &quot;as a mother cares for her children.&quot; Concerns for inclusive language have been raised with respect to issues other than gender. There have been calls for language in the life of the church that includes and welcomes all people, whatever their race, age, ethnic or regional background, or sexual orientation.",

Withholding communion from infants was not a reasoned decision but the result of efforts to protect the eucharistic elements from desecration or from superstitious uses. As early as the twelfth century in some areas infants received only the consecrated wine, for concern had arisen because infants had on occasion regurgitated the bread. In the thirteenth century increased scrupulosity led to withholding the chalice from the laity, which had the effect of excommunicating small children because they had already been denied the bread. In some areas, however, infants and small children continued to communicate until the Council of Trent declared that those lacking use of reason were under no obligation to receive the eucharist. Reformation churches were united in not communicating those who had not reached the age of reason and been catechized. In recent decades, it has been reasserted in various provinces of Anglicanism, and in other churches as well, that baptism is full initiation into the church and the only prerequisite for communion.

After six years at Dover, he went to New York to be the assistant minister at Trinity Church. He began his duties there on June 7, 1765. In New York he became friends with Thomas Bradbury Chandler, rector of St. John&apos;s Church, Elizabethtown, New Jersey. They were leaders in calling for the Episcopate for the American colonies. Inglis became rector of Trinity Church when his predecessor, Samuel Auchmuty, died in 1777. Inglis was a leading Loyalist and very much opposed to the Revolution. Opposition against him mounted. On Nov. 1, 1783, he resigned as rector of Trinity Church and went to England. On Aug. 12, 1787, at Lambeth Palace, he was consecrated the Bishop of Nova Scotia for what was to become the Anglican Church of Canada. He was the first overseas bishop of the Church of England.

        "Institution Narrative",
        "Narration in a eucharistic prayer of Jesus&#8217; institution of the eucharist at the Last Supper, based on 1 Cor 11:23-26 (see Mt 26:26-29; Mk 14:22-25; Lk 22:14-20). The wording of the institution narrative varies slightly in different eucharistic prayers. The institution narrative states that Jesus gave thanks to God, broke the bread, gave it to his disciples, and said the words of institution concerning the bread, &#8220;Take, eat: This is my Body, which is given for you. Do this for the remembrance of me&#8221; (BCP, p. 362). The institution narrative likewise states that after supper Jesus took the cup of wine, gave thanks, shared the cup with his disciples, and said the words of institution concerning the wine, &#8220;Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the new Covenant, which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Whenever you drink it, do this for the remembrance of me&#8221; (BCP, p. 363). Jesus&#8217; words of institution identify the eucharistic bread and wine with his body and blood, and direct his followers to continue this sharing in remembrance of him. Jesus&#8217; words thus &#8220;instituted&#8221; the eucharist, and the eucharistic narration of this event is the institution narrative.\n\nThe words of institution are the same in all Rite 2 eucharistic prayers, and appear in a somewhat different form in Rite 1. The BCP directs that the celebrant is to hold the bread, or lay a hand upon it, at the words concerning the bread. At the words concerning the cup, the celebrant is to hold the cup, or place a hand on it, and any other vessel containing wine to be consecrated (BCP, p. 362). Institution narratives also include brief statements of context concerning the institution of the eucharist at the Last Supper. Prayer A states that the Last Supper was on the night Jesus was handed over to suffering and death (BCP, p. 362); Prayer B states that it was on the night before he died for us (BCP, p. 368); Prayer C and the Rite 1 prayers state that it was on the night he was betrayed (BCP, pp. 334, 342, 371); and Prayer D states that when the hour had come for Jesus to be glorified by God the Father, Jesus loved his own who were in the world, and loved them to the end (BCP, p. 374).\n\nAn institution narrative was included in the third-century eucharistic prayer of Hippolytus&#8217;s Apostolic Tradition. Institution narratives were regularly included in eucharistic prayers after the fourth century. The medieval church came to understand the words of institution as the &#8220;moment of consecration&#8221; of the eucharist, instead of the warrant or basis for the entire eucharistic rite. This emphasis on the words of institution came to be expressed through dramatic elevations of the elements and the ringing of bells. Sacramental theology has once again emphasized the consecration in terms of the entire prayer of eucharistic thanksgiving. However, a vestige of the medieval emphasis on the words of institution can be found in a form for consecrating additional bread or wine at the eucharist. This form combines a brief invocation of the Holy Spirit and a short version of the appropriate words of institution (BCP, p. 408). See Eucharist.",

        "During feudal times in England, a Letter of Institution from the bishop was part of the legal process of induction of a priest to a parish.

In the Episcopal Church, Prayer Books included &#8220;An Office of Institution of Ministers into Parishes or Churches.&#8221; The bishop&apos;s Letter of Institution was read at this service. The 1979 BCP provides a form for the Celebration of a New Ministry (pp. 559-564). A format for the bishop&apos;s Letter of Institution of a Minister precedes this service (BCP, p. 557). It is addressed to the presbyter being inducted in the new ministry. The name and place of the church or place of ministry are stated in the Letter of Institution. The Letter of Institution is appropriate for the induction of a rector of a parish, a cathedral dean, or others with similar tenure of office (BCP, p. 564). The Celebration of a New Ministry begins with the institution. The bishop may read the Letter of Institution at the opening of the service, after the wardens have stated that the new minister is well qualified and properly selected (BCP, p. 559). The Letter of Institution is a sign that the presbyter is &#8220;fully empowered and authorized to exercise this ministry.&#8221;",

        "Ancient liturgical practice of &#8220;blowing in&#8221; the Holy Spirit to the mouth of the candidate for baptism by the celebrant. It was preparatory to the baptism itself. The term is from the Latin in and sufflare, &#8220;to blow.&#8221; It was the counterpart to the &#8220;exsufflation,&#8221; or exorcism of evil spirits by the action of the celebrant, &#8220;blowing&#8221; the evil spirits &#8220;out of&#8221; the candidates. The distinction between &#8220;insufflation&#8221; and &#8220;exsufflation&#8221; has not always been preserved. Insufflation was also used to refer to the action of the priest during the blessing of the font, where the ancient rubric read, &#8220;let the priest breathe three times into the font in the form of a cross . . . .&#8221; Neither insufflation nor exsufflation appears in any English or American Book of Common Prayer. The action is optional in post-Vatican II Roman Catholic liturgies. The biblical roots of the insufflation ceremonies are found in such passages as the second creation story in Genesis which describes God breathing the breath of life into the first human being (Gn 2:7), and the account of Jesus&apos; breathing upon the disciples and imparting to them the Holy Spirit (Jn 20:22).

        "Intention",
        "Conscious or willful purpose to do something. One&#039;s intention is freely chosen and not forced. In terms of moral theology, intention is associated with moral responsibility for an action. For example, a person who intentionally destroys a vase by knocking it off a table is responsible for the damage. But a person suffering from an unexpected seizure is not responsible for the damage if an involuntary movement knocks the vase off the table and breaks it. The outward actions and results may be much the same, but the difference of intent distinguishes these two cases. However, a degree of intent may be found in actions involving negligence or recklessness. For example, a driver who intentionally exceeds the speed limit may not intend to hurt anyone. But the driver has a degree of moral responsibility if others are hurt in an accident caused by the driver&#039;s excessive speed. Of course, that driver&#039;s responsibility is not the same as one who intended to hurt others by causing an accident. In terms of sacramental theology, proper intention is required on the part of the minister of the sacrament or sacramental rite. If the proper intention is lacking, the sacrament or sacramental rite is not understood to be valid. For the minister of the sacrament, the minimal intent is &quot;to do what the Church does&quot; in terms of the particular rite. For example, a priest might go through the motions of a baptism for a dramatic production or demonstration but lack the intention to baptize anyone. Such a dramatic portrayal of a baptism without the intent to baptize would not be a valid sacrament. Similarly, a couple who exchange marriage vows at a wedding rehearsal are not understood to be married. At that moment their intent is to rehearse a ceremony that will happen in the future, not to make the vows of marriage. Proper intent might also be lacking at a marriage due to insanity, intoxication, mistake, or force. Lack of proper intent on the part of one or both of the couple in the wedding would be grounds for annulment of the marriage. A sacrament or sacramental rite would not be valid if the recipient had reached the age of reason and intended not to receive it. A valid sacrament or sacramental rite is not received against one&#039;s will. Proper intention is essential for sacramental validity.

However, the eucharist may be received in both kinds simultaneously, in a manner approved by the bishop (pp. 407-408). Some communicants prefer intinction because of concerns about contagious diseases or alcohol consumption. Separate intinction cups are to be avoided because they contradict the symbolism of the common cup. Intinction was practiced in the east and west by the seventh century. The practice was also motivated by concern that the sacrament might be carried away for superstitious use.

The choir sang the psalm text, and the congregation repeated an antiphon after each psalm verse or group of verses. The antiphon for the introit was typically a verse of scripture. The theme of the introit was suited to gathering the congregation for worship, or possibly the season, feast, or occasion of the day. The introit continued as long as needed to accompany the entrance procession. After reaching the altar, the presider would signal the choir to stop the introit. The entrance psalm would then conclude with the Gloria Patri, which resolved the introit and focused attention on the salutation and readings that followed. By the late middle ages, the introit was reduced to an antiphon, the first verse of the chosen psalm, and the Gloria Patri. Luther preferred use of whole psalms for the introit instead of just one verse. The 1549 BCP used short psalms and sections of Ps 119 for the introit. The 1552 BCP did not include entrance psalms, but permission was given during the rule of Queen Elizabeth for a metrical psalm or hymn to precede the liturgy. The 1979 BCP provides that a hymn, psalm, or anthem may be sung before the opening acclamation of the eucharist (pp. 323, 355).",

        "Investiture Struggle",
        "Controversy in the latter part of the eleventh century and the early decades of the twelfth century between spiritual and temporal authorities over the installation of bishops. Feudal practice allowed kings to install bishops. In some places this led to disappointing and even scandalous appointments. This practice was challenged by Pope Gregory VII (c. 1021-1085) as a usurpation of the church&#039;s authority. Gregory&#039;s struggle with the German King Henry IV eventually led to Gregory&#039;s excommunication of Henry in 1076 and Henry&#039;s submission to the Pope at Canossa in 1077. Henry subsequently set up an antipope after a siege of Rome. Gregory was forced to escape from Rome and died in exile. However, Gregory&#039;s effort to free the church from feudal control eventually was followed by the Concordat of Worms (1122), which represented a workable compromise between ecclesiastical and feudal interests. One of the issues in the investiture struggle was the actual ceremony of investiture of bishops. The land holding of the bishop was conferred by the feudal lord. The symbols of investiture were the bishop&#039;s crozier and ring. These symbols also suggested that the feudal overlord was conferring the power of ecclesiastical jurisdiction on the bishop. The Councils of Clermont (1095) and Rome (1099) forbade bishops to take the feudal oath. The problem was addressed at different times by Guido of Ferrara, Ivo of Chartres, and Hugh of Fleury. They distinguished the spiritual jurisdiction of the church (which was not under feudal control) from the temporal holdings of the bishopric which were under lay control. Negotiations between Anselm of Canterbury and Henry I of England led to the Concordat of London in 1107. This settlement eliminated lay investiture of bishops with the crozier and ring, but called for the bishop to take the oath of vassalage to the feudal overlord in return for the temporal holdings of the bishopric. The Concordat of Worms, a settlement between the church and Emperor Henry V of the Holy Roman Empire, called for free episcopal elections and provided for a &quot;dual investiture.&quot; The crozier and ring, symbolizing ecclesiastical jurisdiction, were conferred at consecration. There was also a temporal investiture with a scepter, representing the temporal holdings of the bishopric. Episcopal elections were to take place in the presence of the Emperor, who had the right to settle disputed cases. Although this controversy was settled in principle by the Concordat of Worms, the struggles of the Papacy and the Holy Roman Empire continued into the thirteenth century. The investiture struggle represented the church&#039;s efforts to disentangle itself from the lay dominance of feudal times. It led to the expanded political power of the medieval papacy.",

The Rule of St. Benedict of Nursia (c. 480-c. 540) called for Ps 95 and an antiphon to be sung daily as the first psalm of Matins. The Jubilate was used as an invitatory psalm in the medieval office of lauds, and in the Jerusalem temple. An invitatory antiphon is used with the invitatory psalm to &quot;invite&quot; the congregation to prayer. The invitatory antiphon gives emphasis to the season or day. The invitatory antiphons may be said or sung before, or before and after the invitatory psalm. The invitatory antiphons may be used with either the Venite or the Jubilate. Responsorial recitation was traditionally used for the Venite. This method calls for the invitatory antiphon to be sung after each verse or group of verses of the invitatory psalm (BCP, p. 582). The complete Ps 95 is appointed to take the place of the Venite on Ash Wednesday, Holy Saturday, and all the Fridays in Lent, including Good Friday.

Some scholars argue that he is a cousin or half-brother of Jesus, and that the word &#8220;brother&#8221; is used in a generic sense to describe his relationship to Jesus. Roman Catholics who uphold the perpetual virginity of Mary do not acknowledge that James was the son of Mary and Joseph. James was clearly a leader of the church at Jerusalem. He presided at the Council of Jerusalem which dealt with issues that divided Jewish and Gentile Christians. James was put to death in Jerusalem by the Sanhedrin in 62. James is traditionally acknowledged as the author of the epistle of James in the NT. James&#8217;s authorship of this epistle has been challenged, but not conclusively refuted. Hegesippus, an early church historian, referred to James as &#8220;the Just&#8221; for his piety, and claimed &#8220;that he was holy from his mother&#8217;s womb.&#8221; James is commemorated in the Episcopal calendar of the church year on Oct. 23.",

James was a fisherman by trade. James and John left their father and their work as fishermen when called by Jesus. They became apostles, and with Peter formed an inner circle in the apostolic group. They witnessed the Transfiguration, the healing of Peter&apos;s mother-in-law, the raising of the daughter of Jairus, and the agony at Gethsemane. Jesus nicknamed the brothers James and John &#8220;sons of thunder.&#8221; Legend claims that James was a great traveler and carried the gospel to Spain. He is the patron saint of that country where he is called Santiago. His work for the Lord in Jerusalem angered Herod, who had him killed about the year 42. He was the first of the apostles to be martyred and the only one whose martyrdom is mentioned in the Bible (Acts 12:1-2). James&apos;s life is commemorated in the Episcopal calendar of the church year on July 25.",

William Jay graduated from Yale College in 1807 and then studied law. From 1818 until 1843, with one short interruption, he was judge of the court of Westchester County, New York. In the years before the Civil War, many Christians continued the campaign against slavery given impetus by the Revolution. Among them were a few white Episcopalians, most notably the Jay family of New York. William Jay contributed an article to the first issue of the Emancipator, which was published on May 1, 1833. In that same year he participated in the founding of the New York City Anti-Slavery Society. He was opposed to the plan of the American Colonization Society to send free African slaves to Africa. He also opposed Episcopal bishops who used the Bible to justify slavery. Jay was one of the founders of the American Bible Society in 1816, and this brought him into conflict with Bishop John Henry Hobart. Hobart wanted to delay emancipation, and limit the evangelicals and their American Bible Society. Hobart criticized inter-denominational societies because he thought they minimized the distinctive characteristics of the denominations and thus weakened the commitment of Episcopalians to their own church. Jay defended the evangelicals and their inter-denominational societies. He was opposed to war as a means to settle international disputes and argued for arbitration. Jay died in Bedford, New York.",

        "The Son of God, the second person of the Trinity, the savior and redeemer of humanity, the Word of God who was made flesh and dwelt among us in the world (see Jn 1:1-18). Jesus was the Messiah, the promised king and ancestor of David who was expected from OT times to deliver the people (see Is 9:6-7; Ez 34:23-24, 37:24-25). His name means &quot;anointed one,&quot; as anointed kings and anointed priests were understood to have been given special powers and functions by God. Christ is also known as &quot;Second Adam,&quot; who reverses the consequences of disobedience by Adam and humanity. St. Paul explains that &quot;as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive&quot; (1 Cor 15:22, RSV). The Episcopal theologian William Porcher DuBose emphasized that Jesus&#039; sinlessness was &quot;His own,&quot; and not the result of a human nature that was somehow incapable of sin or invulnerable to temptation. By God&#039;s grace, through faith, Jesus humanly revealed the obedient righteousness that is the way of salvation. The Nicene Creed affirms that Jesus Christ was eternally begotten and the only Son of God the Father, and is of one being with the Father, &quot;God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God.&quot; All things were made through him; he came down from heaven for us and for our salvation; he became incarnate from the Virgin Mary by the power of the Holy Spirit; he died and was buried after being crucified under Pontius Pilate; and he rose on the third day after his death and ascended into heaven, where he is seated at the right hand of God the Father (see BCP, p. 358). The Apostles&#039; Creed also states that Jesus descended to the dead, or hell, after his crucifixion and before the resurrection (see BCP, pp. 66, 120). The Council of Chalcedon (451) affirmed that the one person of Christ has two natures, divine and human, which are &quot;in no way annulled by the union,&quot; and that Christ&#039;s divine and human natures are &quot;without confusion, without change, without division, without separation.&quot; The Chalcedonian Definition also held that Christ is of one substance (homoousios) with God the Father concerning his divinity and of one substance with us concerning his humanity (see BCP, p. 864). The Christian hope is centered in the victorious Christ, who will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, and whose kingdom will have no end (see BCP, pp. 120, 359). The Athanasian Creed states that at Jesus&#039; coming all humanity &quot;shall rise again with their bodies and shall give account for their own works&quot; (BCP, p. 865). The Christian assurance is that nothing, not even death, will separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord (Rom 8:38-39; BCP, p. 862). The Prayer Book Catechism affirms that Jesus is the only perfect image of God the Father, and he reveals God&#039;s loving nature. Jesus received our human nature from the Virgin Mary, his mother, by God&#039;s own act. The divine Son became human so that we might be adopted as children of God and made heirs of God&#039;s kingdom. We are freed from the power of sin and reconciled to God by Jesus&#039; obedience, which included suffering and death. Jesus overcame death and opened for us the way of eternal life by his resurrection. We share in his victory over sin, suffering, and death when we are baptized into the new covenant and become living members of Christ (see BCP, pp. 849-850). Major events in Jesus&#039; life are recalled in the celebrations and observances of the church year, including his birth (Christmas); his circumcision and naming (Holy Name); the visitation of the Magi (Epiphany); his baptism by John the Baptist (First Sunday after the Epiphany); his Presentation in the Temple (Feast of the Presentation); his Transfiguration (Last Sunday after the Epiphany, and the Feast of the Transfiguration); his triumphal entry into Jerusalem (Palm Sunday); his institution of the eucharist and washing of the disciples&#039; feet (Maundy Thursday); his crucifixion (Passion Sunday, Good Friday); his resurrection (Easter); and his Ascension (Feast of the Ascension). Christ&#039;s triumphal coming again is anticipated in the season of Advent. The Hymnal 1982 provides a section of hymns on Jesus Christ our Lord (Hymns 434-499), including &quot;O love, how deep, how broad, how high&quot; (Hymns 448-449), &quot;My song is love unknown&quot; (Hymn 458), and &quot;The head that once was crowned with thorns&quot; (Hymn 483).

The most significant part of this work is &#8220;On the Orthodox Faith,&#8221; a summary and systematizing of previous eastern theology. During the iconoclastic controversy, which reached its climax in 787 at the Second Council of Nicaea, John was a leading defender of the use of icons. He was an opponent of the Monophysite heresy and of Manichaeism, both of which denied the completeness of the Incarnation. John was the last of the great eastern Fathers of the Church.

        "John of the Cross",
        "(1542-1591). Known as the Doctor of Mystical Theology, Juan de Yepes was born in Fontiveros, Spain. He joined the Carmelites in 1563 and took the name John of St. Matthias. John studied at the University of Salamanca, 1564-1568, and was ordained priest in 1567. In that same year he met Teresa of Avila and joined with her in the reform of the Carmelite Order. On Nov. 11, 1568, he changed his name to John of the Cross. John and Teresa restored the austere Carmelite Primitive Rule which stressed the contemplative life. The friars of this reformed order wore sandals and were soon referred to as Discalced (unshod, no shoes) Carmelites. Those who opposed the reform of the order imprisoned him. For nine months, John lived in a cell six feet by ten feet with very little light. While imprisoned he wrote some of his greatest poetry. He escaped in Aug. 1578 and spent the rest of his life as a leader of the order and a spiritual writer. His major writings were The Ascent of Mount Carmel, The Dark Night of the Soul, The Spiritual Canticle, and The Living Flame of Love. These writings stressed how one reaches perfection or union with God. John was beatified by Pope Clement X in 1675, canonized by Pope Benedict XIII in 1726, and named a Doctor of the Church in 1926. John is commemorated in the Roman Catholic Calendar of the church year on Dec. 14.",

        "John the Baptist",
        "Prophetic forerunner of Jesus. John preached conversion and proclaimed a baptism of repentance. Jesus and many others were baptized by John. John is called &quot;the Baptist&quot; because he was willing to baptize people if they repented to God for their sins. He urged people to repent and be baptized in preparation for a renewal of Israel through God&#039;s eschatological intervention. John is portrayed as focusing on the importance of the future and the possibility of imminent destruction. Many believe that John had been a member of the Qumran community or at least influenced by the thought and practice of Qumran prior to his public appearance. John was the son of Zechariah and Elizabeth. Zechariah was a priest of the Jerusalem Temple. Elizabeth was a kinswoman of the Virgin Mary, and believed to be barren. Zechariah was told by an angel that his son was to be called John. Zechariah responded with unbelief to this news and was made unable to speak by the angel until John&#039;s birth. The child John leaped for joy in Elizabeth&#039;s womb when Elizabeth was visited by Mary (Lk 1:39-44). At that time Mary was pregnant with the child Jesus. On the eighth day after John&#039;s birth, Zechariah insisted that the child&#039;s name was John. Zechariah regained his speech, and uttered the hymn known as the Benedictus Dominus Deus or the Song of Zechariah (Lk 1:68-79; BCP, pp. 92-93). Luke&#039;s gospel begins with a detailed account of John&#039;s birth and his relation to Jesus. Luke, Mark, and Matthew all give a summary of John&#039;s teaching and mention his baptism of Jesus. Matthew is the only one who reports that John questioned whether Jesus should baptize him. Matthew also indicates that when John was in prison he raised a question about whether Jesus was the &quot;one who is to come.&quot; Jesus&#039; reply indicates that he viewed John most favorably but that John is less than anyone who has become a member of the Kingdom of Heaven. According to the Fourth Gospel (Jn 3:25-30), John the Baptist denied that he was the Messiah. John the Baptist likened Jesus to the bridegroom and himself to the bridegroom&#039;s friend. He said that his joy was fulfilled hearing the bridegroom&#039;s voice, and that &quot;He must increase, but I must decrease.&quot; John was imprisoned by Herod Antipas and later executed. John&#039;s birth is celebrated on June 24 in the Episcopal calendar of the church year. John is the focus of the liturgical readings for Advent II and III. His ministry is also recalled by several Advent hymns, including Hymn 76, &quot;On Jordan&#039;s bank the Baptist&#039;s cry.&quot; See Nativity of St. John the Baptist, The.",

The Jubilee is mentioned in Leviticus (Chapters 25 and 27) and Numbers (Chapter 36). This year of liberty and release expresses God&#8217;s sovereignty over creation, and provides a reminder that human beings are stewards of creation who must live justly. The directions for the Year of Jubilee in Leviticus include the repeated instruction, &#8220;you shall not wrong one another.&#8221; Although the Year of Jubilee may not have been actually practiced, it upholds personal rights, human dignity, and family responsibility as ideals. The Year of Jubilee was to be a time of equality and justice for all. The OT Year of Jubilee also provided a biblical image of freedom and equality for African American slaves who yearned for liberty prior to emancipation.In the Roman Catholic Church, the Jubilee Year is a &#8220;Holy Year&#8221; in which a special indulgence is granted to Roman Catholics who visit Rome and fulfill certain conditions. In 1300 Pope Boniface VIII made the first year of each century a year of special indulgence. The intervals between Jubilee years in the Roman Catholic Church was gradually reduced to twenty-five.

The Norwich church was named for St. Julian, probably named after Pope Julian (337-352). The information we have about her is in her writing, The Revelations of Divine Love, also known as the Book of Showings. In this volume she explains that she was thirty years old when at the end of a grave illness she received fourteen revelations or &#8220;showings.&#8221; Later two other visions followed. In her fifties, Lady or Dame Julian wrote about the meaning of these showings. She described her struggles with sin as well as sin&apos;s effect on humanity and on personal relationship with God. The theme of her writings is the great love and compassion of God. She refers to God the Creator as father and mother and refers to the second person of the Trinity as mother. In the Revelations, Julian presents a vision of God in the feminine maternal role. She says God is mother, not simply like a mother. Julian has been called the first English woman of letters and the first English theologian to write in English. She reflects Christian optimism which is not dominated by sin and the Fall. Her spirituality is animated by grace and love. Julian is commemorated in the Episcopal calendar of the church year on May 8.",

        "Proponents of just war theory claim that violent force should be used to protect innocent persons from attack. In contrast, pacifists maintain that war can never be just. Just war theory concerns the moral principles that indicate the justification and limitation of violent force. Drawing upon Roman ideas of just war, Ambrose and Augustine in the fourth and fifth centuries were the first Christian writers to develop a just war theory. A coherent theory based on cases that had been considered was first developed by Gratian in the twelfth century. This theory became the basis for international law. The criteria for going to war (jus ad bellum) include just cause, just authority, right intention, last resort, public declaration, probability of success, and proportionality. A favorable evaluation of proportionality means that the good to be achieved is greater than the evil to be suffered and inflicted. In addition, justice in the waging of war (jus in bello) has focused on two principles: proportionality in regard to the means of warfare rather than the ends; and discrimination or noncombatant immunity in regard to the damage to be caused by warfare. Contemporary Christian pacifism, including much pacifism in the Anglican Communion, comes not from absolute pacifism but from the judgment that modern warfare necessarily violates just war principles, particularly those of proportionality and noncombatant immunity.",

The Psalmist, realizing the weight of sin, acknowledged that God was &#8220;justified&#8221; in pronouncing judgment (Ps. 51:5). God was faithful to the old covenant, which required the Israelites to be morally righteous. St. Paul expressed the heart of the new covenant by the claim that Christians are &#8220;justified&#8221; by faith (trust) in the death of Christ, while nevertheless still sinners (Rom 5:1-11). Christians knew that they had been set in right relation to God in a new covenant although they were not morally righteous. They were justified by grace through faith (Eph 2.8). Justification became the Protestant cry against the medieval penitential system in the sixteenth-century Reformation. The penitential system was felt to require that penitents make themselves just by good works. Luther claimed that a believer was &#8220;simul justus et peccator(at once in a right covenant relation and also sinner). Article XI of the Articles of Religion stated, &#8220;We are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ by faith and not for our work or deservings&#8221; (BCP, p. 870). An Agreed Statement by the second Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC-II), Salvation and the Church (1987), noted that &#8220;the act of God in bringing salvation to the human race and summoning individuals into a community to serve him is due solely to the mercy and grace of God, mediated and manifested through Jesus Christ in his ministry, atoning death and rising again.&#8221;",

Later he moved to Rome, where he taught for the rest of his life. His First and Second Apologies were defenses of Christianity against charges of atheism, immorality, and disloyalty to the Roman Empire. He defended Christians on the basis of their superior moral lives, and he defended Christianity as the oldest monotheistic religion and the true philosophy.

He provides considerable information about the celebration of baptism and the eucharist in the early church.

See Chronos. 2) Kairos is the name for a movement of evangelism and conversion for prisoners. It is modeled on Cursillo, but adapted to the needs and requirements of the situation in prison.

The Anglican theologian Charles Gore (1853-1932) popularized the term in Anglican theology as an explanation of the limitations of our Lord&apos;s human knowledge. Theologians had become acutely aware of these limitations through biblical criticism. Gore suggested that in the Incarnation the eternal Son of God voluntarily abandoned or emptied himself of certain divine attributes such as omnipotence and omniscience. This view was originally outlined in Lux Mundi, which Gore edited in 1889. Later, in response to criticism, Gore modified his position to say that the Son restrained his use of certain divine attributes. Arthur Michael Ramsey (1904-1988) noted that the real source of the kenotic doctrine of Christ&apos;s self-emptying is not the Philippians passage but consideration of the historical data of Jesus&apos; life, considered along with belief in his deity. Although the doctrine of kenosis was helpful at the time in enabling Anglicans to come to terms with biblical criticism, it is less favored today. We accept the full humanity of Jesus, with its limitations. Jesus&apos; embracing the fullness of our human nature did not compromise his divinity. We confess that God was uniquely and salvifically present and active in Jesus&apos; humanity.",

The parish was organized on June 15, 1686, and the church building was opened for worship on June 30, 1689. King&apos;s Chapel remained an Anglican stronghold in Puritan New England throughout the colonial period. When British military forces abandoned Boston in 1776, the rector and many of the parish&apos;s Loyalist members fled to Nova Scotia. Although the church was reactivated under the leadership of lay reader James Freeman a few years later, the congregation held unorthodox theological views. They prepared their own edition of the Prayer Book with all references to the Trinity removed. Bishop Samuel Seabury refused to ordain Freeman because of his Unitarian beliefs. Freeman was ordained by the senior warden of the parish on Nov. 18, 1787. With Freeman&apos;s ordination, King&apos;s Chapel ceased to be an Anglican Church and became in effect the first Unitarian Church in America.",

        "A sign of peace which the people offer in the midst of the eucharistic liturgy. The practice of saluting one another with a kiss dates from ancient times and is recorded in several places in the NT. In the second century Justin wrote: &#8220;At the end of the prayers we greet one another with a kiss.&#8221; Over the centuries the kiss, once exchanged by all, degenerated into a slight bow among the ministers at the altar. In the late middle ages a pax brede (peace board) was also passed among the people, who kissed it. The kiss of peace has two meanings, existing in tension: 1) the greeting of holy people, who love one another and share the peace of the risen Christ, and 2) the reconciliation of sinful people, who seek forgiveness before they share the sacred meal. In the Episcopal Church, consistent with ancient practice, the sign of peace occurs between the intercessions and the preparation of the bread and wine. It may also take place before or after the invitation to communion. The form varies from culture to culture-a kiss on the cheek, a hug, a handshake, hands placed between hands, a bow. The sign is accompanied by &#8220;any appropriate words of greeting&#8221; (BCP, p. 407). See Peace, The.",

        "A traditional posture of prayer in which one&#8217;s weight rests on the knees. The pews of many churches have &#8220;kneelers&#8221; or cushions to protect the knees of those who kneel to pray. Kneeling to pray may express penitence, supplication, and humility. Depending on local custom and personal piety, worshipers may kneel to offer private prayer, during the prayers of the people, while saying the general confession and receiving absolution, during the Great Thanksgiving, to receive communion at the altar rail, during the prayer of thanksgiving after communion, and to receive the blessing. The more traditional of the two invitations to the confession of sin in the Rite 1 eucharistic liturgy (BCP, p. 330) includes a direction for the congregation to make their &#8220;humble confession to Almighty God, devoutly kneeling.&#8221;Recent liturgical reforms, following the ancient practice of the church, encourage the congregation to stand for prayer during most of the times of the service when kneeling has been customary. For example, the rubric in the Rite 2 eucharistic liturgy directs that the people may &#8220;stand or kneel&#8221; after the Sanctus (BCP, p. 362). This emphasis is reversed in the Rite 1 eucharistic liturgy, which states that the people may &#8220;kneel or stand&#8221; (BCP, p. 334). Many believe that standing for the eucharistic prayer emphasizes the eucharist to be a celebration in community rather than an expression of penitence by individuals.",

This saving fellowship with Christ is made possible through the Holy Spirit (Phil 2:1; 2 Cor 13:13). Paul&apos;s collection for the relief of the church in Jerusalem was an expression of koinonia (Rom 15:26, 2 Cor 8-9). Koinonia with Christ was the basis of Paul&apos;s appeal for love and harmony in the chaotic Christian community at Corinth (1 Cor 1:9-10). The reality of this koinonia is expressed in the sacrament of the eucharist (1 Cor 10:16-17). We may share in the community and fellowship of Christ&apos;s sufferings and thereby share in the power and glory of Christ&apos;s resurrection (Phil 3:10-11). Koinonia is listed as one of the four features of Christian community in Acts, expressed concretely in the sharing of goods (2:42).

All baptized persons are members of the Body of Christ, the church, but with different functions and ministries (Rom 12:4-8; 1 Cor 12:12). All Christian ministries and vocations represent specific ways of living out the baptismal covenant (see BCP, pp. 304-305). The ministers of the church are lay persons, bishops, priests, and deacons (BCP, p. 855). The ministry of the laity is &#8220;to represent Christ and his Church; to bear witness to him wherever they may be; and, according to the gifts given them, to carry on Christ&apos;s work of reconciliation in the world; and to take their place in the life, worship, and governance of the Church&#8221; (BCP, p. 855). Clericalism unfortunately caused some to view the ordained as the only real ministers of the church and to regard the laity as inferior to the clergy. Increasing appreciation of lay ministry has accompanied a renewed emphasis on the significance of baptism, and a growing understanding that the various ministries of the church can support and uphold one another. The ministries and orders of the church are to be complementary, and not mutually exclusive.

        "The term &#8220;Last Supper&#8221; does not appear in the NT. It is used to refer to the supper which Jesus ate with his disciples on the evening before his crucifixion. It is described somewhat differently in the gospel accounts (see Mt 26:17-29; Mk 14:12-16; Lk 22:7-23), and in Paul&apos;s reference to it in 1 Cor 11:23-26. The phrase &#8220;Lord&apos;s Supper&#8221; could be based on Paul&apos;s use of the term &#8220;Lord&#8221; in his description of the meal. This dinner is described as a Passover meal in the synoptic gospels but as a pre-Passover meal in John. Jesus instituted the eucharist at the Last Supper when he identified the bread with his body and the wine with his blood of the new covenant. Jesus commanded his disciples to &#8220;do this&#8221; in remembrance of him. Christian understanding of the Last Supper has also emphasized table fellowship shared by Jesus with his disciples and its eschatological implications. See Eucharist.",

        "(1490-Oct. 16, 1555). Bishop and Reformation leader. He was born in Thurcaston, Leicestershire, England, and studied at Cambridge University. At first he was a bitter opponent of the Reformation. Consecrated Bishop of Worcester on Sept. 26, 1535, he quickly became one of the Reform leaders. Although he supported Henry VIII in the dissolution of the monasteries, he played little part in various attempts to introduce changes in church doctrine. His sermons stimulated interest in reform by attacking the superstitions of the clergy and the poverty of those whom they served. He had his greatest fame as a preacher. His career came to an abrupt end when he opposed the Six Articles of Henry VIII. Latimer&apos;s stand was in accordance with his Protestant beliefs. He resigned his see on July 1, 1539. For the remainder of Henry&apos;s reign, Latimer was in the shadow of virtual exile. When Edward VI came to the throne in 1547, Latimer again became a popular preacher. He denounced social and ecclesiastical abuse. His views were suspect when Queen Mary came to power in 1553. On Sept. 13, 1553, he was imprisoned in the Tower and placed in the same room with Thomas Cranmer and Nicholas Ridley. He was burned at the stake in front of Balliol College, Oxford. He exhorted Nicholas Ridley, his fellow victim, with the famous words, &#8220;Be of good comfort, Master Ridley, and play the man; we shall this day light such a candle by God&apos;s grace in England as I trust shall never be put out.&#8221; Latimer, along with Ridley and Cranmer, is commemorated in the Episcopal calendar of the church year on Oct. 16.",

        "Latitudinarian, Latitudinarianism",
        "Spiritual descendants of sixteenth-century humanists like Erasmus and the ancestors of the nineteenth-century broad church party. The middle years of the seventeenth century in England were marked by religious civil war, with royalists (Episcopalians) pitted against Puritans who had left the national church. Those outside the national church included Presbyterians, independents, and sectarians. Oliver Cromwell died in 1658, and his Puritan Commonwealth ended in great disillusionment and unpopularity. In 1660 the Stuart monarchy was restored under Charles II. The restored Stuart kings, however, flirted with Roman Catholicism. This was equally unpalatable to a vast majority of the English. After 1688, the latitudinarians sought to end religious controversy, to make the established church as inclusive as possible, to provide toleration for dissent, and to minimize the importance of doctrine and forms of worship in the interests of &#8220;reasonableness.&#8221;Although many of the &#8220;latitude men,&#8221; like the Cambridge Platonists and their intellectual successor, John Locke, possessed a deep personal piety, some latitudinarians tended toward deism in religion. They saw the church as a department of the state. They considered the church to be necessary to preserve and encourage morality and to support a Protestant monarchy. Gilbert Burnet&#8217;s Exposition of the Thirty-Nine Articles (1699) was written from this point of view.",

He was named Archbishop of Canterbury in 1633. Laud was a practical reformer. He enforced the canons of the church and restored the dignity of public worship. Laud encouraged the use of the surplice, kneeling to receive Holy Communion, bowing at the name of Jesus, placing the altar at the east end of the church, railed altars, and making the sign of the cross. He became one of the most unpopular statesmen of his day. He was unsuccessful in his attempt to enforce liturgical reform in Scotland. His attempts to tighten church organization and impose uniformity of ritual made him the object of intense popular hatred.

A holy life is devotion to God and a regular method of daily prayer. A Serious Call, which was inspired by the teachings of such spiritual writers as Thomas à Kempis, is a forceful exhortation to embrace the Christian life in its moral and ascetical fullness. His major thesis was the unalterable love of God as expressed in Jesus Christ. A Serious Call had a profound impact on Charles and John Wesley. Law was born in King&apos;s Cliffe, Northamptonshire, England. He received his B.A. from Emmanuel College, Cambridge University, in 1708, and was ordained priest in 1711. When Queen Anne died in 1714, he was unable to take the oath of allegiance to King George I and the House of Hanover, and thus became a nonjuror. For 12 years he was a tutor at Putney.

At the time of the early church, readings in the services of the Jewish synagogue were chosen at the reader&apos;s discretion, from a fixed lectionary, or from a sequence of &#8220;in course&#8221; readings (lectio continua). Christian lectionaries developed with fixed patterns of readings. Marion Hatchett notes in his Commentary on the American Prayer Book that there was a system for reading the entire Bible at Matins in the church, but this system did not continue in use past the ninth century. The orderly sequence of readings was disrupted in the middle ages by the increased number of saints&apos; days and their octaves, and the readings of the lives of the saints. The Preface of the 1549 Prayer Book states that &#8220;here is drawn out a Kalendar. . . wherein (so much as may be) the reading of Holy Scripture is so set forth, that all things shall be done in order, without breaking one piece thereof from another&#8221; (BCP, p. 866). The entire NT with the exception of Revelation was read three times in a year by following the Daily Office lectionary of the 1549 Prayer Book. The Daily Office lectionary of the 1979 BCP is arranged so that the NT is read twice and the OT is read once in a two-year cycle of readings (see pp. 936-995). The new eucharistic lectionary of the 1979 BCP provides for the reading of almost the entire NT and a significant part of the OT over a three-year cycle of readings (see pp. 889-921). Sequences of in course readings are frequently provided in the selections of the Daily Office lectionary and the eucharistic lectionary.",

This monastic reading led to meditation and prayer, with wisdom and appreciation as its goals. It was distinguished from a scholastic reading, which led to questions and disputations, with science and knowledge as objectives.

The season now known as Lent (from an Old English word meaning &#8220;spring,&#8221; the time of lengthening days) has a long history. Originally, in places where Pascha was celebrated on a Sunday, the Paschal feast followed a fast of up to two days. In the third century this fast was lengthened to six days. Eventually this fast became attached to, or overlapped, another fast of forty days, in imitation of Christ&apos;s fasting in the wilderness. The forty-day fast was especially important for converts to the faith who were preparing for baptism, and for those guilty of notorious sins who were being restored to the Christian assembly. In the western church the forty days of Lent extend from Ash Wednesday through Holy Saturday, omitting Sundays. The last three days of Lent are the sacred Triduum of Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Holy Saturday. Today Lent has reacquired its significance as the final preparation of adult candidates for baptism. Joining with them, all Christians are invited &#8220;to the observance of a holy Lent, by self-examination and repentance; by prayer, fasting, and self-denial; and by reading and meditating on God&apos;s holy Word&#8221; (BCP, p. 265).",

Leo&apos;s letter, called a Tome, was read at the Fourth Ecumenical Council at Chalcedon in 451. It stated clearly that Jesus Christ was one person in two natures. This was a great victory for Rome, for Leo, and for western theology. At Chalcedon the papal legate said, &#8220;Peter has spoken through the mouth of Leo.&#8221; The Definition of the Union of the Divine and Human Natures in the Person of Christ, adopted at Chalcedon, evolved from Leo&apos;s Tome.

Appropriate lessons for other services, such as An Order of Service for Noonday and Compline, are provided in those services. The gospel at the eucharist is to be read by a deacon, or by a priest or bishop if a deacon is unavailable. All other lessons may be read by lay people. The NT lesson at the eucharist is also known as the epistle. A lay person who reads a lesson is known as a lector. Lessons may be said or sung. Lessons have been announced since the twelfth century. The 1549 Prayer Book required the announcement of the lesson to include the citation of the chapter from scripture, and the 1662 BCP required citation of the verse. The 1979 BCP makes citation of the chapter and verse optional. The lector need only say &#8220;A reading (or lesson) from _________,&#8221; and name the scriptural book which is the source of the lesson.

        "Liberal catholicism, as a theological development in Anglicanism, had its beginnings in the publication of Lux Mundi (1889), a collection of essays written by Oxford Anglican teachers and edited by Charles Gore. Lux Mundi took the doctrine of the Incarnation as a central theme for interpreting Christian faith in light of the conflicts which were of great importance at the end of the nineteenth century: evolution and the historical criticism of the Bible. Liberal catholicism was a movement which also sought to integrate the sacramental and ritualistic aspects of the Tractarian movement with such social concerns as urban poverty, industrialism, war, and the development of a Christian socialism.&nbsp;Theologically, the best exposition of the concerns of liberal catholicism can be found in Essays Catholic and Critical (1926) and in the writings of William Temple, Archbishop of York and later of Canterbury. The movement received its final, official expression in <em>Doctrine in the Church of England</em> (1937). Certain themes predominate in all the writings which represent the liberal catholic movement: revelation and history in the Bible, religious experience, the uniqueness of Christ and the Christian revelation, the synthesis of religious belief and intellectual integrity, and the relationship of the church to the political and social order.In all these concerns the authority of Christian belief in the rapidly changing social, scientific, and philosophical culture of the European world between the first and second World Wars was fundamental to liberal Catholicism.The influence of liberal catholicism upon the Episcopal Church in the United States can be seen in various statements and papers of General Convention on ecumenism and the authority of scripture, as well as social and moral questions. The fundamental concern with the authority of Christian belief in those documents reflects the liberal catholic concern for accepting the genuine historical development of cultures in the light of the Incarnation. Episcopal theologian William Porcher DuBose (1836-1918) reflected liberal catholic influence in his concern to rediscover the tradition of the church in new ways and contexts.&nbsp;",

The evangelical party flowered in the nineteenth century and still continues to be influential. A crisis of faith was created during the nineteenth century by the rise of new historical and scientific methods and the widespread replacement of the Platonic and Aristotelian philosophies by the new thought of Kant, Hegel, John Stuart Mill, and others. Liberal evangelicals sought to incorporate the new learning in a reformulated evangelical theology which retained its loyalty to the gospel and its emphasis on atonement and sanctification while at the same time accepting a critical stance toward the biblical text, the evolutionary account of creation, a scientific attitude toward miracles, a morally based criticism of doctrines like predestination, and a commitment to social justice as a major Christian obligation.

Although liberation theology has been centered in Latin America, its growth may be seen in theological calls for liberation of oppressed people in a variety of contexts and places. Its influence may be seen in the related movements of African American theology and feminist theology. Certain themes are characteristic of liberation theology: 1) Conscientization, or bringing into awareness one&apos;s own situation and its causes; 2) The use of Marxist analysis as a discriminate social analysis concerning the present historical situation of oppression; 3) The insistence of the union of thought and praxis; 4) The recovery of biblical themes as a basis for reflection; and 5) The condemnation of &#8220;development&#8221; in capitalist terms as a solution to poverty.

        "An early ecumenical movement seeking, along with the Faith and Order Movement, the reunion of the separated Christian churches. Unlike the Faith and Order Movement, whose principal concern was theological, Life and Work emphasized the practical cooperation of separated churches in the moral, ethical, and social application of Christian faith in the world. It stressed the relation of the Christian faith to society, politics, and economics. Doctrinal differences between the churches were minimized. The earliest and chief proponent of the movement was Archbishop Nathan Söderblom of Uppsala, of the Swedish Lutheran Church. The first Universal Christian Conference on Life and Work met at Stockholm, Aug. 19-30, 1925. The second meeting, which was called the World Conference on Church, Community, and State, met at Oxford, July 12-26, 1937. The Episcopal Church sent seven delegates to the second meeting. Life and Work became a commission of the World Council of Churches when the WCC was founded in 1948. See World Council of Churches (WCC); see Faith and Order.",

        "The home of the community and household of prayer founded by Nicholas Ferrar (Feb, 22, 1592-Dec. 4, 1637) in Huntingdonshire, England, about 18 miles from Cambridge. Ferrar and his mother and some 40 members of his extended family and household retired to this deserted estate in 1625 and dedicated themselves to a life of prayer and Christian ministry. The mansion house was repaired and the little church, which had been used as a barn, was restored. Ferrar, a celibate, was ordained deacon in 1626. The community lived under a systematic rule of life based on the principles of the Church of England and the Prayer Book. Little Gidding was more a household and family with a shared life of prayer, charity, and work than a monastic community, but it has been seen as an experiment in family monastic living. Ferrar led the community in the Daily Offices of the church, the daily singing of the entire Psalter, hourly prayer offices throughout the day, and nightly vigils. The local vicar led the community in the celebration of Holy Communion on the first Sunday of every month. The Little Gidding community was quite generous in charity. They visited and helped the poor and sick and operated a dispensary. They also established a small academy for the education of children. Members of the community were involved in writing stories to illustrate themes of Christian faith and morality. The community was also involved in bookbinding and produced illustrated harmonies of the gospels. Ferrar died in 1637. He is commemorated in the Episcopal calendar of the church year on Dec. 1. The Puritans opposed the Little Gidding community. A pamphlet titled The Arminian Nunnery (1646) criticized Little Gidding for attempting to introduce Roman Catholic practices in England. The community continued until 1646 when it was raided by Oliver Cromwell&apos;s soldiers and dispersed. &#8220;Little Gidding&#8221; is the title of the last of the Four Quartets (1935-1942) by the poet T. S. Eliot, who describes a place &#8220;Where prayer has been valid. And prayer is more/ Than an order of words.&#8221; See Ferrar, Nicholas.",

        "Liturgical Movement, The",
        "A movement of liturgical renewal and reform, rooted in new discoveries concerning the Christian liturgical tradition and new insights into the experience of common worship. The liturgical movement was encouraged by new developments and insights in the fields of biblical studies, patristic studies, and ecumenism during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The liturgical movement emphasized the active participation of all Christians in the liturgy. It also sought to view the prevailing practice of liturgy in light of the witness of the early church and to recover certain liturgical expressions from the early Christian tradition. The liturgical movement originated in the Roman Catholic Church, especially in the Benedictine Order. In 1833 the ancient monastery at Solesmes, France, was re-established under the leadership of Dom Prosper Gu&eacute;ranger (1805-1875). The Benedictine community at Solesmes became a major center for research concerning chant in the 1870s. This community founded or influenced many Benedictine foundations during the period from 1833 to 1900. The Benedictine or monastic phase of the liturgical movement was followed by further research and scholarship concerning Christian liturgy. Liturgical scholarship concerned important documents such as the Didache (discovered in 1875 and published in 1883), and the publication of other sources such as the Canons of Hippolytus and the Apostolic Constitutions. Scholars came to approach liturgy in light of historical critical methods. The popular liturgical movement has been dated from an address by Dom Lambert Beauduin (1873-1960) at the National Congress of Catholic Action at Malines, Belgium, in 1909. Beauduin&#039;s address, &quot;The Full Prayer of the Church,&quot; called for the active participation of the people in the church&#039;s work, especially in the liturgy. Beauduin&#039;s approach was based in parochial ministry, and it expressed theoretical concepts in popular language. The popular liturgical movement was advanced through publications, conferences, and the media. An important aspect of the liturgical movement was its intentional drawing together of the liturgy and the social issues facing the church&#039;s people. The popular liturgical movement in America has been dated from the travels and work of Dom Virgil Michel (1890-1938), a monk of St. John&#039;s Abbey, Collegeville, Minnesota, who visited Benedictine monasteries and Beauduin in Europe, 1924-1925. After Michel returned, the American liturgical movement began at St. John&#039;s with the founding of Orate Fratres (which later became Worship) and the Liturgical Press under Michel&#039;s leadership. In the Roman Catholic Church, the liturgical movement culminated in the reforms of the Second Vatican Council&#039;s Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy (1963). The liturgical movement spread beyond the Roman Catholic Church and led to the reform of the books and forms of worship of many churches during the later twentieth century, including the Anglican Communion and the Episcopal Church. The Anglican Communion began to feel the influence of the liturgical movement in the 1920s and 1930s. A. G. Hebert wrote Liturgy and Society in England (1935). The advance of the English liturgical movement was encouraged by the Parish and People Movement. In the Episcopal Church, Dean William Palmer Ladd of Berkeley Divinity School helped to introduce the liturgical movement to the Episcopal Church. Massey H. Shepherd, Jr., and Bayard Hale Jones, both seminary professors associated with the Church Divinity School of the Pacific and the University of the South, were leaders in the work of liturgical revision. Walter Lowrie also encouraged the advance of the liturgical movement in the Episcopal Church. Shepherd helped to found the Associated Parishes in 1946. Associated Parishes&#039; tracts and conferences helped to educate the membership of the Episcopal Church concerning liturgical reform. Shepherd&#039;s Oxford American Prayer Book Commentary was published in 1950. It reflected many of the concerns of the liturgical movement and the discoveries of liturgical scholarship. Also in 1950 the Standing Liturgical Commission began publishing a series of Prayer Book Studies. The 1958 Lambeth Conference set forth guidelines for Prayer Book revision in the Anglican Communion, and these guidelines were further developed by the 1963 Anglican Congress. The eucharistic rite of the 1928 BCP was criticized in light of the principles of the liturgical movement. The relative lack of opportunity for congregational participation was one of the issues of concern, along with the penitential tone of the rite. The process of Prayer Book revision and trial use took place in the Episcopal Church during the 1960s and 1970s. A revised BCP was given final approval in 1979. The liturgies of the 1979 BCP reflect many of the concerns of the liturgical movement, including a strong emphasis on participation of the laity, the recovery of ancient forms such as the Easter Vigil, and renewed emphasis on the importance of baptism. These concerns are fully discussed in Marion J. Hatchett&#039;s Commentary on the American Prayer Book (1981).",

The life of Christ active in the church by the Spirit is expressed through liturgy.In ancient Greece, liturgy indicated work done for the public at private expense. Such public works were not necessarily religious in nature. The Septuagint uses the term for divine worship. In the NT, the term is identified with an act of service or ministry (Phil 2:30).The unity of the members of the church in Christ is expressed most fully in liturgy. Liturgy expresses the church&#8217;s identity and mission, including the church&#8217;s calling to invite others and to serve with concern for the needs of the world. Whether the liturgy is done by many or few, it is the corporate liturgy of the whole church. Liturgy does not include private devotions or acts of piety by individuals and groups. For example, saying the Rosary is not a liturgy.Liturgy is sacramental. Outward and visible realities are used to express the inward and spiritual realities of God&#8217;s presence in our lives. Liturgy reflects the belief of incarnational theology that tangible and finite things may reveal divine grace and glory. By the Spirit, through liturgy, the church manifests the love of God and the unity we share in Christ. This loving unity was shared by the Father and the Son, and it is offered to all Christian believers. Liturgy is a public and social event. It engages our lives and faith, our thoughts, feelings, hopes, and needs-especially our need for salvation in Christ. Liturgy includes actions and words, symbols and ritual, scriptures and liturgical texts, gestures and vestments, prayers that are spoken or sung. It is also shaped by the seasons, feasts, and fasts of the calendar of the church year and the lectionaries for the Holy Eucharist and the Daily Office (BCP, pp. 15-33, 888-1001). Liturgy is to involve the various members and ministries of the church so that all are drawn together into one living expression of divine worship. It expresses what we believe and know about God, including belief and knowledge that cannot be completely stated in words.The term &#8220;liturgy&#8221; may refer to the rites or texts that order the church&#8217;s worship. It may indicate in particular the eucharist, which is also known as the Divine Liturgy (BCP, p. 859). In eastern Christianity, the term is applied more narrowly to the eucharist and not to other rites of divine worship. In the west, it includes all public rites and offices of the church.",

It is also known as the ministry of the word.

It is also used as a christological term, which is believed to have originated from use in Hellenistic Judaism as a synonym for the divine wisdom. In this sense it designates God&apos;s self-communication. This communication takes place in the act of creation, in the providential government of creation, in human religious experience, and in the calling of Israel to be God&apos;s people and in its subsequent history. This self-communication of God reaches its climax in the Christ event, the Word made flesh (Jn 1:1-14). In the early period of the Church Fathers, logos became a designation for the second person of the Trinity. In time it was generally replaced by the title &#8220;Son,&#8221; which seemed to preserve more faithfully the personal relationship between the second person and God the Father. In the Episcopal eucharistic lectionary, Jn 1:1-14 is the gospel for the third eucharist of Christmas Day, and for the first Sunday after Christmas, with the addition of verses 15-18. The collect for Christmas I celebrates the fact that in the Incarnation, God the Father has &#8220;poured upon us the new light of (his) incarnate Word.&#8221; (BCP, p. 213).",

Modern liturgical revisers restored general intercessions to the people and made them more diverse and suitable for modern congregations. The BCP provides several forms of intercession, especially for Rite 2. The BCP also allows parishes to adapt and change these forms and to create new prayers. General intercessions include six categories of those in need: the church, the world, the nation, the community, the suffering, and the dead (BCP, p. 383).",

        "Lord, The",
        "The term is an English translation of several words from Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek indicating a person or deity with power and authority. The Hebrew Adon indicates a superior or human master, with Adonai used almost exclusively for divine lordship. The BCP notes that Adonai is used in the Psalms with reference to God, and translated &#8220;Lord&#8221; (p. 583). The personal name YHWH, the &#8220;Four-letter Name&#8221; (Tetragrammaton), was the Hebrew special name for God. It was probably vocalized &#8220;Yahweh,&#8221; but by around the third century B.C. it was considered too sacred to be pronounced. Adonai was most frequently substituted for it. This reverence and reticence concerning the name of God was also seen in the classical English of the Prayer Book Psalter and the OT of the King James Version, which regularly rendered the name of God as &#8220;Lord.&#8221; This usage continues in the Psalter of the 1979 BCP. When Lord is used to translate YHWH, it is represented in capital and small capital letters (see Ps 150, v. 6, BCP, p. 808); but Lord is represented in capital and lower case letters when it translates Adonai (see Ps 37, v. 14, BCP, p. 634). Greek translations from the second century B.C. used kyrios for the Hebrew YHWH, and this Greek usage continued in the NT. During his earthly ministry, Jesus may have been called &#8220;lord&#8221; as a title of respect. However, after the resurrection, the title was applied absolutely by the Christian community to Jesus Christ as the Lord, so that kyrios became a confessional title for Jesus Christ in the NT (see Acts 2:36; Rom 10:9-13; 1 Cor 12:3; Phil 2:11). The full divinity of Jesus was subsequently affirmed by the Councils of Nicaea (325) and Chalcedon (451). The word &#8220;Lord&#8221; is frequently used throughout the liturgies of the Episcopal Church. For example, at the eucharist the celebrant begins the salutation by saying, &#8220;The Lord be with you.&#8221; After the reading of each lesson, the reader may say, &#8220;The Word of the Lord&#8221;; and the gospeler says &#8220;The Gospel of the Lord&#8221; after the gospel (see BCP, pp. 357-358). However, the appropriateness of the term &#8220;Lord&#8221; for contemporary liturgical use has been questioned because it has been seen as a term of masculine domination.

The BCP states that the eucharist is &#8220;the principal act of Christian worship on the Lord&apos;s Day&#8221; (p. 13).

        "This prayer of Jesus was given to his disciples as an example of how they should pray. The phrase &#8220;Lord&apos;s Prayer&#8221; is not used in the NT. The prayer is found in Mt 6:9-13 as part of the Sermon on the Mount and in Lk 11:2-4 when Jesus and the disciples are on the road to Jerusalem. Luke&apos;s version is shorter and more compact than Matthew&apos;s. Scholars have argued that the Lord&apos;s Prayer was originally part of the &#8220;Q&#8221; source and that Luke&apos;s version is probably closer to the original. As a prayer, the Lord&apos;s Prayer is similar to Jewish prayers. It begins with an address to God the Father, continues with petitions which ask God to act in a way which would achieve his purposes, and then has petitions which ask for God&apos;s help. The traditional closing, the doxology, is probably a later addition. It is not found in Luke nor in all the manuscripts of Matthew&apos;s gospel. The Lord&apos;s Prayer is said at Baptism, Eucharist, the Daily Offices, and other services of the Episcopal Church. The BCP includes both contemporary and traditional language versions of the Lord&apos;s Prayer (see BCP, p. 364).

During this period, it was virtually synonymous with &#8220;latitudinarian.&#8221; Low church teaching minimized the authority of the episcopate and tended to exalt royal supremacy. This loyalty to the throne was not because of the divine right of kings. It reflected a convenient anti-Roman Catholic political arrangement, since the Hanoverians were safely Protestant. The low church party stressed the importance of preaching as moral discourse and tended to assign sacraments to a subordinate place in church life. In this sense, they had a &#8220;low&#8221; doctrine of the church.In the nineteenth century the term was used in contrast to the high church position of the Oxford reformers. In this case, &#8220;low church&#8221; designated the evangelicals. They were followers of the Wesleys who remained in the Church of England. Thus in this period, low church teaching became associated with individualism, personal religious experience, dislike of ritual, conversion by the power of the Holy Spirit, a strong emphasis on the authority of scripture, and evangelistic preaching. The term &#8220;low church&#8221; continues to carry these connotations in the early twenty-first century. See High Church.",

        "A simple celebration of the eucharist in which the celebrant was typically assisted by only one server. The entire liturgy was said, not sung. The priest typically read all the lections and led all the prayers. The celebrant thus took over the prior liturgical roles of the deacon, lector, cantor, and choir in the eucharist. The priest alone said certain texts that were previously said with the congregation. Low mass dates from the late middle ages in the western church. All priests were expected to celebrate the Mass daily, and the traditional fullness of celebration was compromised. It became the most frequent celebration of the eucharist in the west. Low mass was never allowed in the east.The congregation at low mass was relatively passive as the service was done for them by the celebrant. However, this tendency was countered by the Anglican Prayer Book tradition. The eucharistic liturgy of the 1549 Prayer Book was in the vernacular. It included responses that were made by the congregation. The 1789 American Prayer Book encouraged participation of lay readers by using the word &#8220;Minister&#8221; instead of &#8220;Priest&#8221; in certain directions. The 1979 BCP calls for lay persons to read the lessons other than the gospel at the eucharist. The eucharistic gospel is to be read by the deacon if a deacon is present. A deacon or lay person is to lead the prayers of the people. Representatives of the congregation are to present the people&#8217;s offerings of bread and wine, and money or other gifts (BCP, p. 361). Various eucharistic texts are reserved for the congregation, or appointed to be said by the celebrant and congregation together. In these ways the liturgical roles of the eucharist are once again shared by the congregation and ministers other than the celebrant. Although the term &#8220;low mass&#8221; is obsolete, it is sometimes used loosely to indicate a simple eucharist that is said.",

It works from the conclusion that we do not have any original copies of any scriptural material. When one manuscript is not exactly the same as another, it is necessary to find a way to determine which text is closest to the original. Because there are many scriptural manuscripts from different times and places, most of the arguments are based on how and why scribes might be the cause of the differences. The primary principle is the assumption that the text which is hardest to explain is likely to be the earliest. If we can explain why a scribe at a certain time and place might have caused a specific reading, then it is likely that the particular reading is non-original. Many scholarly Hebrew and Greek texts print a revision of the material which the critics have argued is the most original, with the significant manuscript variations listed at the bottom of the page.

In the liturgy for ordaining deacons, the ordinand had to say: &#8220;I, A. B., utterly testify and declare in my conscience, That the King&#8217;s Highness is the only Supream Governour of this Realm, and of all other his Highnesses Dominions and Countries, as well in all Spiritual or Ecclesiastical things or causes, as Temporal: And that no foreign Prince, Person, Prelate, State, or Potentate hath or ought to have any jurisdiction, power, superiority, pre-eminence or authority Ecclesiastical or Spiritual within this Realm. And therefore I do utterly denounce and forsake all foreign jurisdictions, powers, superiorities and authorities; and do promise, That from henceforth I shall bear faith and true allegiance to the King&#8217;s Highness, His Heirs and Successors, and to my power shall assist and defend all jurisdictions, priviledges, pre-eminences and authorities granted or belonging to the King&#8217;s Highness, His Heirs and Successors, or united and annexed to the Imperial Crown of this Realm. So help me God.&#8221; All Church of England clergy in the American colonies had taken this oath of allegiance to the King. When the colonies declared independence from England, Loyalist clergy who believed this oath was binding fled the country. After American independence, the requirement for the loyalty oath delayed the ordination of Samuel Seabury as first Bishop of Connecticut and the first bishop in the Episcopal Church. Seabury was finally ordained bishop in Scotland by nonjuring bishops of the Episcopal Church in Scotland in 1784, with no loyalty oath to the English sovereign required. See Loyalists.",

He was a physician and is identified with the church&apos;s ministry of healing. In Col 4:14, he is described as &#8220;the beloved physician.&#8221; Many Episcopal hospitals have the name of St. Luke because he is the patron saint of healing and the healing professions. His uniqueness is seen in his detailed description of the birth of Jesus, possibly deriving from information given him by Mary, the Lord&apos;s mother. It is in the Gospel According to Luke that we have the texts of the earliest Christian hymns, Magnificat, Benedictus, and Nunc dimittis . Only this gospel has the parables about the Good Samaritan and the Prodigal Son. Luke gives special emphasis to the worth and status of women. He stresses the inclusivity of the compassion and love of God. Luke is often symbolized as a winged sacrificial ox holding a gospel book. This symbolism is taken from the Gospel According to Luke, which begins with Zechariah sacrificing in the temple and which describes the sacrifice of Christ. Luke is sometimes pictured as a painter making Christ known through art. Luke accompanied Paul on his second missionary trip from Troas to Philippi, and on the third missionary trip from Philippi to Jerusalem. He also went with Paul to Rome. Luke&apos;s life and work as a physician, historian, and evangelist is commemorated in the Episcopal calendar of the church year on Oct. 18.",

        "(Nov. 10, 1483-Feb. 18, 1546). Founder of the sixteenth-century Reformation in Germany. He was born in Eisleben, Thuringia, Germany. Luther was baptized on Nov. 11, 1483, the Feast of St. Martin of Tours, and named after the saint. He received his M.A. in Feb. 1505 from the University of Erfurt. On July 17, 1505, he entered the cloister of the Order of St. Augustine in Erfurt. He was ordained priest on Apr. 4, 1507. In 1511 Luther transferred to the monastery in Wittenberg. In the next year he was named Professor of Holy Scripture at the University of Wittenberg. In 1514 he had an experience which enabled him to understand the righteousness of God in a totally new way. He came to believe that righteousness is a gift of God and that a merciful God justifies us by grace through faith. On Oct. 31, 1517, Luther posted his 95 Theses on the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg. This date is regarded as the beginning of the Reformation. On June 15, 1520, Pope Leo X signed the papal bull, Exsurge Domine, condemning 41 of Luther&apos;s teachings. One of Luther&apos;s major contributions was translating the Bible into German. He was a musician and wrote numerous hymns. Seven of Luther&apos;s hymns are used in The Hymnal 1982, including &#8220;Savior of the nations come!&#8221; (Hymn 54), &#8220;When Jesus went to Jordan&apos;s stream&#8221; (Hymn 139), and &#8220;A Mighty Fortress is our God&#8221;(Hymn 687). He wrote the music used in &#8220;Before thy throne, O God, we kneel&#8221; (Hymn 575) and the musical setting that was the basis for S 283, Te Deum laudamus. Luther died in Eisleben.

The purpose of the essays was expressed in the preface to the first edition which noted that the real development of theology is &#8220;the process in which the Church, standing firm in her old truths, enters into the apprehension of the new social and intellectual movements of each age.&#8221;   Essays in the volume were written by young theologians associated with Oxford University, many of whom made significant contributions to theological scholarship later in their lives, including Gore himself, Henry Scott Holland, J. R. Illingworth, R. C. Moberly, and F. Paget. The volume provoked much protest, especially the essay by Gore on the inspiration of Holy Scripture.

It begins, &#8220;O ruler of the universe, Lord God, great deeds are they that you have done, surpassing human understanding.&#8221; It is also known as the Song of the Redeemed. In this heavenly vision, the victorious faithful sing the Song of Moses and the Song of the Lamb. The Song of Moses was the celebration of Moses and the people of Israel after they crossed the Red Sea and escaped from bondage in Egypt (Ex 15:1-18; See Canticle 8, Cantemus Domino, BCP, p. 85). The Song of the Redeemed reflects a vision of the completion of salvation for the faithful in heaven, as the Song of Moses was a great event in the history of God&apos;s mighty acts in the world for human salvation. Magna et mirabilia draws together several OT passages. It may have been an early Christian hymn. It first appeared as a Prayer Book canticle in the 1979 BCP. It concludes with a doxology. Magna et mirabilia is recommended for use at Morning Prayer after the NT reading on Mondays and Saturdays and after the NT reading at Morning Prayer on Thursdays in Advent and Lent (BCP, p. 144). The Hymnal 1982 Accompaniment Edition, Vol. 1, provides several musical settings for Magna et mirabilia (S 267-S 271).

It is attributed to Mary in the Lucan narrative, but a minority of ancient authorities attributed it to Elizabeth. The term is from the opening words of the passage in the Latin Vulgate, Magnificat anima mea Dominum (&#8220;My soul magnifies the Lord&#8221;). The Magnificat strongly resembles and may have been modeled after the Song of Hannah (1 Sm 2:1-10), which is quite similar in its structure and themes. Both songs emphasize God&#8217;s holiness and power, God&#8217;s option for the poor and judgment on the rich, the fulfillment of God&#8217;s promises, and the redemption of God&#8217;s people.The Magnificat is the traditional canticle of vespers. It was the only canticle for use after the first lesson of Evensong in the 1549 BCP. It was not used in the 1789 American BCP, but it was restored in the 1892 BCP. The 1928 BCP allowed its use as the only canticle at Evening Prayer when one lesson was read. The 1979 BCP permits use of the Magnificat at both Morning Prayer and Evening Prayer. It appears as Canticles 3 and 15 in the BCP, and it is printed in both the Rite 1 and Rite 2 forms for Evening Prayer. It may also be used at the Act of Thanksgiving in the Thanksgiving for the Birth or Adoption of a Child (BCP, pp. 441-442).The Hymnal 1982 has a variety of settings for the Magnificat (S 242-S 247), including Plainsong, Tonus Peregrinus, adapted by Bruce E. Ford (S 242) and the setting Cathedral of the Isles by Betty Carr Pulkingham (S 247). The hymn text &#8220;Tell out, my soul&#8221; by Timothy Dudley-Smith (Hymns 437-438) is based on the Song of Mary.",

        "The term traditionally refers to the holy orders of bishop, priest, and deacon. The major orders were distinguished from minor orders such as porter (doorkeeper), lector, exorcist, and acolyte. The subdiaconate was considered a minor order until it was included among the major orders by Pope Innocent III in 1207. The subdiaconate was suppressed in the Roman Catholic Church in 1972. A few Episcopal churches continue to allow a liturgical role for a &#8220;subdeacon&#8221; at the eucharist. The minor orders were transitory steps that led to the major orders. This hierarchical understanding of ministry is also reflected in the requirement that all candidates for the priesthood must first be ordained as deacons before ordination as priests. This requirement dates from the ninth century. It led to decreased appreciation for the significance of the diaconate. Since all Christian ministry is &#8220;major&#8221; and rooted in baptism and the promises of the baptismal covenant, the term &#8220;major orders&#8221; can be misleading. The Catechism states that &#8220;the ministers of the Church are lay persons, bishops, priests, and deacons&#8221; (BCP, p. 855). However, the Preface to the Ordination Rites does acknowledge the ancient origin of the &#8220;three distinct orders of ordained ministers&#8221; of bishops, priests, and deacons which &#8220;have been characteristic of Christ&#8217;s holy catholic church.&#8221; This Preface adds that it is &#8220;the intention and purpose&#8221; of the Episcopal Church to &#8220;maintain and continue&#8221; the three orders. Candidates for these ordained ministries are &#8220;admitted to these sacred orders by solemn prayer and the laying on of episcopal hands&#8221; (BCP, p. 510).

He argued that the God of the OT was a God of legalism and strict justice. In contrast, the God of the NT was a God of grace and love. For Marcion, the OT God who created the world was a lower deity, subordinate to the God revealed in Jesus Christ.This dualism led Marcion to reject the OT as inspired writing. He acknowledged a severely truncated NT, consisting of the Gospel According to Luke and the ten genuine Pauline epistles all purged of what Marcion regarded as judaizing material. The church declared Marcion&#8217;s teaching heretical. But the widespread popularity of his teaching forced orthodox Christianity to develop and defend its own list of canonical books. The popularity of Marcionism also prompted Christianity to assert the goodness of creation by the one God of both Testaments.",

The union is understood to be intended by God for their mutual joy; for the help and comfort given one another in prosperity and adversity; and, when it is God&#8217;s will, for the procreation of children and their nurture in the knowledge and love of the Lord (BCP, p. 423). At the Declaration of Consent, both persons promise to love, comfort, honor, and keep their spouse, in sickness and in health, and, forsaking all others, to be faithful to their spouse as long as they both live (BCP, p. 424). The congregation witnesses the couple&#8217;s promises, and the members of the congregation promise to do all in their power to uphold the couple in their marriage. At the Marriage, the couple may pledge their lives to each other by the giving and receiving of rings as symbols of their vows. When desired, other appropriate symbols of their vows may be used instead of rings. In the Episcopal Church it is required that at least one of the parties be a baptized Christian, that the ceremony be attested by at least two witnesses, and that the marriage conform to the laws of the state and the canons of the church.

These court pages were usually from the upper ranks of the culture. They cared for the king and his living quarters. King Mwanga&apos;s court was a place of considerable homosexual activity. The king liked handsome young men, and his position gave him access to many of them at court. The boys and young men who became Christians refused his homosexual advances, and he viewed their refusals as insubordination.

He demanded that those who were Christians renounce Christ. None of them did. He then pronounced the death sentence on a large number of them, and those not condemned to death were taken away and castrated. On Ascension Day, June 3, 1886, 32 of them were killed.

The Boston Handel &amp; Haydn Society Collection of Church Music (1821) went through twenty-two editions. Mason often based his work on European collections, including pieces from Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and other German composers. He was able to further his goal of reform by improving the standards of church music in America. He transformed the music publishing business, and by 1872 he had produced almost sixty different church music collections. Many of these collections went through multiple editions. Selected Chants, Doxologies etc. Adapted to the use of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America (1824) represents his effort to serve the need for chant in the Episcopal Church. Mason also excelled as an educator. Through his work at his Boston Academy of Music, music education became part of the curriculum of Boston public schools, the first public school music program in the United States. Mason was a leader in the teacher-training movement and the first to publish a Sunday School hymnal with music. Many of his hymns remain in use today.

In 1823 Maurice entered Trinity College, Cambridge University, to study law. However, he was denied his degree because as a Nonconformist he refused to subscribe to the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion. After several religious crises, he decided to enter the Church of England. He was ordained priest in 1834. From 1840 until 1846, Maurice was Professor of English Literature and Modern History at King&apos;s College, London. In 1846 he was appointed Professor of Theology at the same school. From 1848 until 1854, he was a leader of the Christian Socialist Movement. He insisted that &#8220;Christianity is the only foundation of Socialism, and that a true Socialism is the necessary result of a sound Christianity.&#8221; In 1853 he published Theological Essays, in which he criticized the popular view of eternal punishment. He was dismissed from his position at King&apos;s College for teaching opinions &#8220;calculated to unsettle the minds of the theological students.&#8221; His major publication was The Kingdom of Christ (1838). He urged that the church must be a united body, transcending the diversities and partialities of its individual members, factions, and sects. He insisted that the true church had six signs: baptism, creeds, set forms of worship, the eucharist, an ordained ministry, and the Bible. These ideas may have influenced William Reed Huntington and the Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral. In 1854 he helped to establish the first Working Men&apos;s College in London. It provided a platform for his radical social reform. In 1866 he was elected to the Knightsbridge Professorship of Moral Theology at Cambridge, where he lectured on ethical subjects. He died in Cambridge. Maurice had a significant influence on the founders of the Episcopal Theological School. Since World War II there has been a revival of interest in Maurice as a theologian.

He received his B.A. in 1938 and his M.A. in 1939, both from Columbia University. He was a nominal Anglican in his younger years but converted to Roman Catholicism in 1938. In 1940-1941, Merton taught English at St. Bonaventure College. In 1941 he joined the Order of Cistercians of the Strict Observance, or Trappists, and entered Our Lady of Gethsemani Abbey near Bardstown, Kentucky. He took the name Brother Louis in the order. He wrote extensively on the monastic life and spirituality. Especially notable are The Seven Storey Mountain (1948), The Sign of Jonus (1953), New Seeds of Contemplation (1961), and Contemplative Prayer (1969). His writings also show a keen and critical awareness of the issues of his time. Merton became a fierce opponent of nuclear weapons. He is also known for an extensive correspondence of spiritual advice and direction. Author of over 140 books, Merton influenced the renewal of interest in spirituality which has been felt in the Episcopal Church. In later years, Merton was given permission to live as a hermit. He also became interested in Buddhism, and published books such as Zen and the Birds of the Appetite (1968). Merton traveled in Asia, and visited the Dalai Lama.

        "Messiah",
        "From the Hebrew, &#8220;anointed&#8221; or &#8220;anointed one,&#8221; indicating a person who has been anointed with oil. Messiah is translated in Greek as christos, and the title &#8220;Christ&#8221; is derived from it. The one who is ceremonially anointed is understood to be set apart by God with special powers and functions. In the OT, the anointed one most frequently refers to the king of Israel (1 Sm 10:1, 26:9, 11, 16, 23; 2 Sm 1:14, 16). Priests were also anointed (Ex 28:41; Lv 4:3, 5, 16).After Samuel anointed David king over Israel, the spirit of God came mightily upon David from that day (1 Sm 16:1, 13). The prophet Nathan declared God&#8217;s promise to make the throne of David&#8217;s offspring an everlasting kingdom (2 Sm 711b-17; see 2 Sm 22:51, Ps 89:20-37). The messiah came to mean the idealized Davidic king whose coming was hoped for by Israel. This understanding reflects the influence of the &#8220;royal&#8221; psalms concerning God&#8217;s anointed, such as Psalms 2, 18, 20, 45, and 132. The prophet Isaiah states the hope and expectation for the king who would establish the throne of David and his kingdom and &#8220;uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time onward and forevermore&#8221; (Is 9:7; see Is 11). Similarly, the prophet Jeremiah declares the coming of the days when God &#8220;will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land&#8221; (Jer 23:5). And Ezekiel prophesies concerning the time when David will be the king and one shepherd of the people of Israel, and &#8220;David shall be their prince forever&#8221; (Ez 37:24-25). Christians believe Jesus Christ to be the fulfillment of the messianic expectation of the OT. The Davidic ancestry of Jesus is established in the NT (Mt 1, Lk 1). Jesus is explicitly identified as the Messiah in the NT (Mt 1:1, 1:18, 11:2; Lk 2:11). Jesus&#8217; identity as the Messiah is recognized by Simeon (Lk 2:25-35), and by Peter (Mt 16:16, Mk 8:29). In the Gospel of John (1:40-41), Andrew says to his brother Simon Peter, &#8220;We have found the Messiah.&#8221; Jesus identifies himself as the Messiah in his conversation with the Samaritan woman at the well (Jn 4:25-26). Jesus is the suffering messiah who rose from the dead, who reigns in heaven, and who will come again in power and glory (Mk 8:31; Lk 24:26; Acts 2:36, 3:18, 3:20-21, 5:31, 26:23). Jesus is understood in the NT to be the Messiah, the Christ, and &#8220;Christ&#8221; is used as a name for him in the letters of Paul (see Rom 1:1, 5:8; 1 Thes 1:1). The Prayer Book Catechism affirms that Jesus is the Messiah, the one &#8220;sent by God to free us from the power of sin, so that with the help of God we may live in harmony with God, within ourselves, with our neighbors, and with all creation&#8221; (p. 849). The Messiah who comes &#8220;to take away transgression, and rule in equity&#8221; is celebrated by the hymn &#8220;Hail to the Lord&#8217;s Anointed&#8221; (Hymn 616). An important theme in the season of Advent is the victorious return of the Messiah, when &#8220;every eye shall now behold him, robed in dreadful majesty&#8221; (&#8220;Lo! he comes, with clouds descending,&#8221; Hymn 57).

        "Methodists, Methodism",
        "A group of Protestant churches founded in England in the eighteenth century on the principles and practices of John Wesley, a priest of the Church of England. Methodism spread from England to the American colonies. It became an important expression of religious life and thought in the New World. Methodism was marked from the outset by its acceptance of the doctrines of historic Christianity. It did not insist strongly on conformity nor did it display a great interest in theological speculation. It emphasized the power of the Holy Spirit to confirm the faith and transform the personal life of the believer. Methodism asserts that the heart of true religion lies in the believer&apos;s relationship with God. One of its strong characteristics is its concern for the underprivileged and the improvement of social conditions. Methodism had its origins in the work of John and Charles Wesley. They were members of a group of earnest students at Oxford University who were pledged to frequent attendance at Holy Communion, serious study of scripture, and regular visitation of Oxford prisons. Members of this group were called Methodists. Methodism came to the American colonies around 1760. It was a part of the Great Awakening. Since Methodist &#8220;societies&#8221; were part of the Church of England in the American colonies, they were not persecuted like the Baptists. In Sept. 1784 John Wesley and Thomas Coke ordained Thomas Vasey and Richard Whatcoat as the first Methodist ministers for America. At the &#8220;Christmas Conference&#8221; of 1784 at Lovely Lane Chapel, Baltimore, the Methodist societies were organized as the Methodist Episcopal Church. Many evangelical members of the Episcopal Church joined the Methodist Church. The Episcopal Church is in official dialogue with three African American Methodist bodies and participates with the United Methodist Church in the Consultation on Church Union.

They were authorized for use before and after services and sermons. The Hymnal 1982 contains William Kethe&apos;s version of Ps 100, &#8220;All people that on earth do dwell&#8221; from the 1562 edition (Hymns 377-378). The &#8220;Old Version&#8221; was used in England into the eighteenth century. It was generally replaced by the &#8220;New Version&#8221; of Nicholas Brady and Nahum Tate, which was first published in London in 1696. The Hymnal 1982 contains three texts in altered versions from this collection (Hymns 364, 658, 666). The &#8220;New Version&#8221; was used by English colonists in America before the Revolution and was bound with the first BCP for publication in 1789. The 1832 General Convention substituted selections from the psalms for the whole Psalter. Most of these were from the &#8220;New Version,&#8221; but sixteen were from other sources. The BCP allows use of metrical versions of the invitatory psalms and of the canticles after the readings at Morning and Evening Prayer (BCP, p. 141).",

The term is from the Latin mille, &#8220;a thousand.&#8221; Millenarianism is based on the description in Revelation, Chapters 20-21. Christ and his saints are to rule for a thousand years while Satan is bound in chains and history is incomplete. Satan is to be unbound at the end of the millennium. Christ will win the final victory, the last judgment will separate the elect, and God will create for them a new heaven and a new earth. Millenarianism is often used in a general sense of an urgent expectation of a time of joy in the near future. Historically, this hope has been especially keen at times of distress or suffering. During the Great Awakening in America, millenarianism took the form of an expectation of the second coming of Christ after a thousand-year period of Christian progress. This was known as postmillennialism. In contrast, those expecting the return of Christ to precede the thousand-year rule may be termed &#8220;premillennialists.&#8221; Various groups of Christians have believed (incorrectly) that they knew in advance the time of Christ&apos;s second coming, including the followers of the American William Miller who expected the millennium in 1843 or 1844. The Christian hope is &#8220;to await the coming of Christ in glory, and the completion of God&apos;s purpose for the world&#8221; (BCP, p. 861). See Eschatology.

The movement of liturgical renewal and reform in the second half of the twentieth century reclaimed the earlier sense of the word, so that ministry once more denotes the life of service of all baptized persons. The Prayer Book Catechism states, &#8220;The ministers of the Church are lay persons, bishops, priests and deacons&#8221; (p. 855).",

The minor orders date from at least the third century. Ordination to minor orders in the early church included a commission to exercise the office and the handing over of instruments appropriate to the office. For example, a doorkeeper would be given keys to the church, and a lector would be given a book. The subdiaconate was considered a minor order until it was included among the major orders by Pope Innocent III in 1207. The subdiaconate was suppressed in the Roman Catholic Church in 1972. Pope Paul VI also abolished the orders of porter and exorcist in 1972. Lay people, candidates for the diaconate, and candidates for the priesthood can now be installed in the ministries of lector and acolyte in the Roman Catholic Church. These lectors and acolytes are not ordained or in holy orders. A few Episcopal churches continue to allow a liturgical role for a &#8220;subdeacon&#8221; at the eucharist. Lay servers at the altar in many Episcopal parishes are known as acolytes.

Use of the missal dates from the tenth century. The Roman Missal was used by mendicant friars and officials of the Roman Curia who traveled through Europe. The Roman Missal came to be used or imitated in many places. In 1570 Pope Pius V published a revised edition of the Roman Missal that reflected the directives of the Council of Trent. This edition of the Roman Missal was required for all dioceses, churches, and religious communities that did not have a missal of their own which they had used for at least 200 years. Use of a missal has never been required in the Anglican liturgical tradition. The 1549 Prayer Book provided liturgical texts and prayers for the eucharist, including introits, collects, epistles and gospels for the church year. It also included the contents of the breviary, the missal, priests&apos; manuals, and a revised form of the English litany of 1544 which had replaced the book of litanies and processions. The Ordinal (ordination rites) continued to be printed separately until the 1662 Prayer Book.

Although these supplementary materials may be drawn from a variety of sources, the Latin Rite is typically the primary source. The American Missal was first published by Morehouse Publishing in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1931. The American Missal drew upon the English Missal, the Anglican Missal (published by the Society of Saints Peter and Paul), and the People&apos;s Missal, all of which had been published in England. The ceremonial directions of the American Missal were not intended to contradict the Prayer Book rubrics, but the directions of the American Missal conformed the liturgy to &#8220;the common tradition of Western Catholic Christendom&#8221; when no definite provision was required, or when alternate usage was allowed. A revised edition of the American Missal was published in 1951 by Earle Hewitt Maddux of the Society of Saint John the Evangelist in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It also drew on English, Scottish, Irish, and South African Prayer Books for supplementary materials. An American Edition of the Anglican Missal was published in 1943 by the Frank Gavin Liturgical Foundation of Mount Sinai, New York.

For example, the Protestant Episcopal Society for the Promotion of Evangelical Knowledge was organized in 1847 and subsequently published The Mission Service. It was used in the Army, the Navy, prisons, and new settlements. Bishops were authorized by the 1856 General Convention to provide simplified services for congregations that could not use the Daily Offices of the Prayer Book. The 1892 BCP permitted a third daily service drawn from the Prayer Book and used at the discretion of the diocesan bishop. Similarly, the directions &#8220;Concerning the Service of the Church&#8221; in the 1928 BCP allowed the use of &#8220;other devotions&#8221; taken from the Prayer Book, or set forth by lawful authority in the church, or from scripture.

The church seeks to restore all people to unity with God and each other in Christ. The church carries out its mission through the ministry of all its members (BCP, p. 855). The Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society of the Protestant Episcopal Church includes all members of the Episcopal Church.After the resurrection, Jesus commanded the 11 remaining disciples to proclaim the good news to the whole creation (Mk 16:15; see Mt 28:19-20). He promised the apostles that they would receive power when the Holy Spirit had come upon them and that they would be his witnesses &#8220;in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth&#8221; (Acts 1:8). Christians were scattered during the persecution of the church that followed Stephen&#8217;s martyrdom. Those who were scattered went from place to place, proclaiming the word (Acts 8:4; see Acts 11:19). After his conversion to Christianity, Paul undertook three missionary journeys (see Acts 13-14, 15:36-18:21, 18:23-21:16).

Praxeas taught that Word and Spirit were simply names (or modes) of God, applicable at different times. Praxeas also taught that the Father himself was born of Mary, suffered, died, and rose again. This form of modalism is therefore sometimes called patripassianism. Sabellius understood Father, Son, and Holy Spirit to be nothing more than aspects or modes of the one divine Person. Modalist teaching held that Father, Son, and Spirit were successive manifestations or modes-at one time in the OT world, then in the world of the gospels and then the church.

Extreme modernist positions were condemned by Pope Pius X in the encyclical Pascendi (1907). Roman Catholic modernists exerted considerable influence on Anglican liberalism, particularly on the synthesis between broad church and high church represented by Charles Gore and expressed in Lux Mundi, a collection of essays which Gore edited and published in 1889. An Anglican modernist association, the Modern Churchman&apos;s Union, disseminated Anglican versions of modernist views for half a century through its annual conferences and quarterly journal, The Modern Churchman.

        "A person who devotes his or her life to religious vows and who lives in community (in or associated with a monastery) or as a solitary. Monastic communities lead a life devoted to God in a monastery, in relative isolation from the world. Although monastic vows differ from tradition to tradition, they normally include poverty, chastity, and obedience. A monastic&#8217;s schedule may be divided into prayer, study, and work. Eastern monks follow the rule of St. Basil, and most western monks follow the rule of St. Benedict. Monks are bound by solemn vows. They live in relatively independent abbeys ruled by an elected abbot, with the highest authority residing in a general chapter. The general chapter includes all the professed members of the order. Monastic and canonical orders were discontinued in England by Henry VIII but restored in the Anglican Communion during the nineteenth century.A renewal of Anglican monasticism was encouraged by the Oxford Movement. In England, E. B. Pusey heard the vows of two women who started a religious community in 1845. Other religious communities formed in England in the mid-nineteenth century. Episcopal monasticism began with sisterhoods formed in the mid-nineteenth century and was strengthened when the Community of St. Mary (CSM) was founded by Mother Harriet and her companions in 1865 on Feb. 2, the Feast of the Presentation. The Rev. Charles C. Grafton, a native of Boston and later Bishop of Fond du Lac, was one of the founders of the first Anglican monastic orders for men after the Reformation, the Society of St. John the Evangelist (SSJE) in England in 1866. Grafton returned to the United States and the Episcopal Church in 1872 to serve as rector of the Church of the Advent, Boston, and to lead the work of the SSJE in the United States. The first indigenous monastic order for men in the Episcopal Church was the Order of the Holy Cross (OHC), founded by the Rev. James O. S. Huntington in New York in 1884. Today the Episcopal Church includes a variety of religious orders and other Christian communities. According to the canon on Religious Orders and Other Christian Communities, a religious order is a society of Christians in communion with the See of Canterbury who voluntarily commit themselves for life or a term of years to holding their possessions in common or in trust, to celibate life in community, and to obedience to their rule and constitution.",

She was deeply committed to Augustine&apos;s conversion to Christianity. He did convert to Christianity in 386. Monica died in Ostia, Italy. In 1430 her remains were moved from Ostia to the Church of St. Augustine in Rome. Because of her influence on Augustine to become a Christian, she is recognized as a model for Christian mothers. Monica is commemorated on May 4 in the Episcopal calendar of the church year on the day before Augustine&apos;s conversion, May 5, 386.",

Coptic and Ethiopian churches refused to subscribe to the Chalcedonian Definition and are still known as monophysite churches.

It presented the Person of Christ as having one divine will under which his human will was subsumed. Monothelitism was consistent with the Chalcedonian Definition concerning the two natures of the Person of Christ. But monothelitism upset the balance between Christ&apos;s divinity and his humanity by upholding only one independent divine will. It was declared heretical at the Sixth Ecumenical Council (III Constantinople) in 680-681, which held &#8221; . . .there are two natures unconfusedly, unchangeably, undividedly, and two natural wills and two natural operations. . . .&#8221; See Chalcedonian Definition; see Ecumenical Councils; see Christology.",

Their &#8220;revelations&#8221; carried the adherents of the new sect to extreme and unorthodox claims. All members of the sect, clerical or lay, were encouraged to prophesy in the power of the Spirit. They made a new call for moral rigor in the face of the rampant immorality of the surrounding secular society. They proclaimed the imminent end of the world. The movement spread rapidly through the Christian world, but it disappeared in less than a century. Tertullian became a Montanist near the end of his life because of the moral rigor of its teaching.

He was the son of Moravian missionary parents who intended that he become a minister. However, he was dismissed from seminary in 1792 because of his preoccupation with writing poetry. He became assistant to the editor and owner of the Sheffield Register, a radical newspaper. After the owner fled because of political persecution, Montgomery took over the paper. He renamed it The Iris, continued its liberal editorial policy, and used it for the occasional publication of his hymns. Imprisoned twice because of his political leanings, he became an outspoken and well-known opponent of the slave trade, child labor, and state lotteries. He supported foreign missions and the Bible Society. Although he was associated with Wesleyan Methodists, Montgomery became a supporter of Thomas Cotterill, rector of St. Paul&apos;s, Sheffield. Cotterill was attempting to popularize the singing of hymns in the Anglican Church. Montgomery was the author of over four hundred hymns. The Hymnal 1982 contains nine of his texts, including &#8220;Shepherd of souls, refresh and bless&#8221; (Hymn 343), &#8220;When Jesus left his Father&apos;s throne&#8221; (Hymn 480), and &#8220;Hail to the Lord&apos;s Anointed&#8221; (Hymn 616).

        "Moral Theology",
        "Theology that focuses on development of moral principles and norms and their application to human actions in general and to particular situations. Moral theology provides a systematic framework for casuistry and has reflected the concerns of casuistry. Traditional moral theologies broadly assumed the theology of Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274). Roman Catholic texts began with a consideration of the ends of human action, considered how we come to know and do the good, focused on the principles and norms of action, addressed particular cases, and placed decision-making in the larger context of the sacramental life of the church (especially sacramental confession). The content of moral theology was shaped by an understanding of the end of human life as the beatific vision. Union with God was understood to be realized in the cardinal and theological virtues. The principles and norms of action were developed in terms of the Ten Commandments or the virtues themselves. Contemporary Roman Catholic moral theologies address the same questions but with a traditional focus on sacramental confession. Without the requirement of sacramental confession, Anglicans never developed a clearly accepted body of teaching that could be called a system of Anglican moral theology. Significant contributions to Anglican moral theology date from the period of the English Reformation, most notably Richard Hooker and Jeremy Taylor. Anglican moral theology was renewed in the wake of the Oxford Movement, most notably by Kenneth Kirk. See Beatific Vision; see Cardinal Virtues; see Casuistry; see Theological Virtues.",

        "Morning Prayer",
        "In many times and places, daybreak has been a time of prayer. Jews prayed in their synagogues at sunrise as well as at other times each day. This Jewish pattern of prayer formed the basis of the Christian monastic Daily Office, with its prayers or &#8220;hours&#8221; at seven times in each day. Thomas Cranmer&#8217;s revision of the Daily Office for the first English Prayer Book (1549) reduced the number of services to two-one for morning (Matins) and one for evening (Evensong or vespers). In the Second English Prayer Book (1552), the morning service was given its present name, Morning Prayer.Many elements of Morning Prayer come from the monastic hours of matins (e.g., Venite and Te Deum), lauds (e.g., Benedicte, omnia opera Domini, a &#8220;chapter&#8221; of scripture, Benedictus Dominus Deus, collect of the day), and Prime (e.g., a second &#8220;chapter&#8221; of scripture and the Apostles&#8217; Creed). Psalms were recited at every one of the offices, with the whole Psalter recited once a week. In the 1549 BCP, psalms were read at both Morning and Evening Prayer, with the whole Psalter read &#8220;in course&#8221; once each month. In subsequent Prayer Book revisions, psalms have come to be used more selectively, although a monthly cycle of psalms read &#8220;in course&#8221; is still provided as an option. In the 1549 Prayer Book, the very short monastic &#8220;chapters&#8221; were lengthened to full chapters of both the OT and NT at both Morning Prayer and Evening Prayer. In the 1979 BCP, only one lesson must be read, and the appointed lessons are not so long.Morning Prayer once was the chief Sunday service in most Anglican churches on three out of four Sundays, the First Sunday usually being a celebration of Holy Communion. This practice has not continued because the eucharist has been recognized as the &#8220;principal act of Christian worship on the Lord&#8217;s Day&#8221; in most parishes (see BCP, p. 13), However, Morning Prayer is clearly designated as a daily service for the worship of the church.

Additional parts add additional paraphrased texts and tones. The motet dates from the thirteenth century, when words were added to the upper part of two-part compositions. The upper parts of these compositions had previously been vocalized without words.

The church year has two cycles of feasts and holy days, one dependent on the movable date of Easter Day and the other dependent on the fixed date of Christmas, Dec. 25 (BCP, p. 15). Easter Day is the first Sunday after the first full moon after the spring equinox on Mar. 21. This date is fixed in accordance with an ancient ecclesiological computation, and may not correspond to the astronomical equinox (BCP, p. 880). Easter cannot be earlier than Mar. 22, and it cannot be later than Apr. 25. The BCP provides tables and rules for finding the date of Easter Day (pp. 880-883).The date of Easter determines the date for many feasts (and fasts) of the church year.

        "Mozarabic Rite",
        "The ancient liturgy of the Christian church in Spain. Its center was at Toledo. The term is derived from Arabic, &#8220;a would-be Arab.&#8221; Its use stems from the centuries when Spain was under Arab or Moslem rule. Elements from eastern rites found their way into the liturgy of the church in Spain. The Mozarabic Rite continued the use of three lessons at the eucharist, the weekly singing of the Creed, and the use of other canticles. Contrary to eastern use, the phrase &#8220;and the Son&#8221; was found in the Creed in the Mozarabic Rite. Some elements of the BCP are drawn from the Mozarabic Rite. These elements include the prayer for the sanctification of the water at baptism (p. 307), the third Prayer for Light in the Order of Worship for the Evening (pp. 110-111), and the use of the Trisagion (p. 356). Mozarabic chant from the Mozarabic Rite is represented in The Hymnal 1982, including a setting of the Sanctus (S 123).",

        "Muhlenberg Memorial",
        "Statement presented by William Augustus Muhlenberg, rector of the Church of the Holy Communion, New York City, and others to the House of Bishops of the Episcopal Church at the 1853 General Convention. It reflected Muhlenberg&apos;s ecumenical vision of a church both catholic and reformed that could include all Christians. It proposed &#8220;some ecclesiastical system, broader and more comprehensive than that which you now administer, surrounding and including the Protestant Episcopal Church as it now is, leaving that Church untouched, identical with that Church in all its great principles, yet providing for as much freedom in opinion, discipline, and worship as is compatible with the essential faith and order of the Gospel.&#8221; The Memorial upheld the traditional catholic teaching of the Episcopal Church concerning the Creeds, the eucharist, and episcopal ordination. It urged that Episcopal bishops should ordain qualified Protestant clergy who could accept the basic teachings of the Episcopal Church. These clergy would continue to serve in their own denominations. The apostolic succession was thus to be shared more widely through the Episcopal Church for a comprehensive Protestant Church. The Memorial also urged that the Episcopal Church should relax &#8220;somewhat the rigidity of her Liturgical services.&#8221; Although the immediate results of the Memorial were small, it heralded the beginning of significant ecumenical activity in the Episcopal Church and later movements for liturgical reform. It is seen as the precursor of the Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral (1886-1888), and the Commission on Church Unity of the House of Bishops (1856). The Commission on Church Unity eventually became the Standing Commission on Ecumenical Relations of the General Convention. See Muhlenberg, William Augustus.",

He went to Halle, Germany, for his education. After several years he returned to America. He studied for the Lutheran ministry with Carl Magnus von Wrangel, Provost of the Swedish churches on the Delaware. In Feb. 1769 Muhlenberg took charge of the Lutheran churches at Bedminster and New Germantown, New Jersey. In 1771 he was called to be the pastor of the German Lutheran congregation at Woodstock, Virginia. He went to England for ordination because the Church of England was established in Virginia. Muhlenberg was ordained priest on Apr. 23, 1772, by the Bishop of London. He returned to Woodstock as the pastor of the Lutheran congregation. There is no evidence that he was ever ordained a Lutheran pastor. In Jan. 1776 he preached his farewell sermon on Ecclesiastes 3, which mentions &#8220;a time for war, and a time for peace.&#8221; At the end of the service he removed his clerical gown, revealing under it his military uniform. He was a successful soldier in the Revolutionary War. Afterwards he served in a variety of political positions. Muhlenberg died in Gray&apos;s Ferry, Pennsylvania.",

        "Muhlenberg, William Augustus",
        "(Sept. 16, 1796-Apr. 8, 1877). A leading Episcopal priest of the nineteenth century. He was born in Philadelphia and baptized in the Lutheran Church. When the vestry of St. James&apos; Episcopal Church gave his widowed mother a free pew, she attended that church and William grew up an Episcopalian. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1815 and then studied theology with Bishop William White and Jackson Kemper. Muhlenberg was ordained deacon on Sept. 21, 1817, and served as Bishop White&apos;s assistant at St. Peter&apos;s and Christ Church in Philadelphia. He was ordained priest on Oct. 22, 1820. He went to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where he served as co-rector with Joseph Clarkson of St. James&apos; Church. Muhlenberg&apos;s chief early interest was education, and in 1828 he founded and served as headmaster of Flushing Institute, a boys&apos; school in Flushing, New York. In 1838 he established St. Paul&apos;s College on Long Island Sound. Although neither institution survived very long, they were both influential models of Christian schools which others copied. The Church of the Holy Communion was built at the corner of Sixth Avenue and 20th Street, New York, by his sister, Mrs. Mary A. Rogers. Muhlenberg became the rector of this church in 1846. In 1851 he founded a monthly church journal, The Evangelical Catholic, which reflected his desire for ecumenical union with the Protestant bodies of Christendom. The Evangelical Catholic was published for two years. In 1852 Muhlenberg and Anne Ayres founded the Sisterhood of the Holy Communion. The greatest of his philanthropies was the founding of St. Luke&apos;s Hospital in New York City, which opened in 1858. In 1853 he was the leader in presenting a memorial to the House of Bishops asking for certain reforms in the liturgy and for extension of episcopal ordination. He sought to relax the liturgical rigidity of Episcopal services and to provide the apostolic succession through the Episcopal Church for a comprehensive Protestant church. The document became known as the Muhlenberg Memorial. In 1870 Muhlenberg incorporated St. Johnsland on Long Island, which was an experiment in Christian communal living. He died at St. Johnsland. His ministry is commemorated in the Episcopal calendar of the church year on Apr. 8. See Muhlenberg Memorial.",

        "This feast of our Lord is celebrated on June 24 in the Episcopal calendar of the church year. Luke&#8217;s gospel (Chapter 1) records that John was miraculously born to Zechariah and Elizabeth. They were childless and advanced in age when John was conceived. The angel Gabriel told Zechariah that Elizabeth would bear him a son who would be named John. Zechariah received this startling announcement with disbelief, and he was struck speechless. Zechariah&#8217;s speech was restored on the eighth day after John&#8217;s birth, when John was named and circumcised. At this time, Zechariah uttered the canticle known as the Benedictus Dominus Deus(Lk 1:67-79), which is one of the canticles for the Daily Office (see Canticles 4 and 16, BCP, pp. 50-51, 92-93). Elizabeth was in the sixth month of her pregnancy when Gabriel appeared to Mary at the Annunciation. Mary was related to Elizabeth, and Gabriel told Mary that Elizabeth had conceived a son in her old age. The feast of the Nativity of John the Baptist was originally associated with the Epiphany, but its observance was moved to June 24 in the west and June 25 in the east. This feast is celebrated about six months before Christmas, as Elizabeth was in the sixth month of her pregnancy at the time of Jesus&#8217; conception. Propers for celebration of the Nativity of John the Baptist were included in the Leonine, Gelasian, and Gregorian sacramentaries. The feast was included in the 1549 BCP.As an adult, John lived an ascetic life in the Judean wilderness. His life and appearance recalled the prophetic tradition of the OT. He was clothed with camel&#8217;s hair and wore a leather belt. He ate locusts and wild honey. The word of God came to him, and he went into the region around the Jordan River to preach a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. John called the people to prepare for the coming of the kingdom of God and the advent of the Messiah. Many people came to John to receive his baptism, including Jesus. John exhorted the people to live righteously (see Lk 3:10-14). He told them to share clothes and food with the needy. He urged tax collectors to collect no more than was appointed for them, and he told soldiers to rob no one by violence or false accusation. John stated that he was not the Christ (Jn 1:20). John acknowledged that his influence would decrease as Christ&#8217;s influence increased (Jn 3:30). He had many followers, some of whom later became disciples of Jesus (Jn 1:35-37). John criticized Herod the tetrarch for his incestuous marriage to Herodias, and for other evil deeds. John was imprisoned, and later executed at the urging of Herodias (Mt 14:1-12).

        "Natural Law",
        "Universal moral law that is given by God and knowable by human reason. It has been understood in terms of ethics that can be derived from reflection on ordinary human experience and contrasted with law that is divinely revealed. These universal standards provide norms of right conduct that may serve as the basis for moral choices in particular situations and the statutes of civil law. Our ability to discern the natural law may be diminished by sin. St. Paul states that although the Gentiles do not have the Mosaic law, they &#8220;show that what the law requires is written on their hearts, to which their own conscience also bears witness&#8221; when they &#8220;do instinctively what the law requires&#8221; (Rom 2:14-15). Thomas Aquinas holds in the Summa Theologica that the rational creature &#8220;has a share of the Eternal Reason, whereby it has a natural inclination to its proper act and end,&#8221; and that natural law is the rational creature&apos;s participation in the eternal law by which the divine providence governs creation. Natural law may be understood as a rule of action that is implicit in the very nature of things. The specific content of the universal moral laws and their application has been subject to disagreement. However, natural law principles have been used as a basis for contemporary legislation in several countries. See Enlightenment, The.",

Neale was caught up with the ideals of the Oxford Movement while he was at Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1839 Neale and Benjamin Webb founded the Cambridge Camden Society. After 1845 it was known as the Ecclesiological Society. The Society&apos;s goals focused on church architecture and traditional catholic worship. Neale was ordained deacon in 1841 and priest in 1842. His early ordained ministry was limited by poor health. After a period of rest, Neale was appointed warden of Sackville College, East Grinstead, in 1846. He also devoted himself to literary work and the Society of St. Margaret, a religious order for women, which he founded in 1855. The Bishop of Chichester inhibited Neale from 1847 to 1863 because of his ritualistic practices. Today Neale is primarily remembered as a translator of ancient Greek and Latin hymns. His two major publications, Medieval Hymns and Sequences (1851) and Hymns of the Eastern Church (1862), had a major impact on English language hymnals published in the second half of the nineteenth century. Neale contributed nearly an eighth of the texts of the original edition of Hymns Ancient and Modern (1859). His translations continue in use today. The Hymnal 1982 contains twenty-seven texts or portions of texts that were translated by Neale, including such classics as, &#8220;All glory, laud, and honor&#8221; (Hymns 154/155), &#8220;Come, ye faithful, raise the strain&#8221; (Hymns 199/200), and &#8220;Of the Father&apos;s love begotten&#8221; (Hymn 82). The Hymnal also has two original texts by Neale, including &#8220;Good Christian friends, rejoice&#8221; (Hymn 107). Neale died in East Grinstead on the Feast of the Transfiguration, 1866.

When he was freed in 1698, he raised money in Europe for the Huguenots before returning to New York. While still a Presbyterian, he was licensed by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG) on Aug. 4, 1704, as a catechist and became a missionary to the slaves in New York. In Oct. 1704 he resigned as an elder with the Huguenots and joined Trinity Church, New York City. From 1705 until 1714 he was a member of the vestry of Trinity Church. The chief factor in his becoming an Episcopalian was his regard for the Prayer Book. Neau&apos;s school for slaves met in the belfry of Trinity Church and later on the third floor of his house.

In response, we are to believe in Christ and keep his commandments. Love is to be at the heart of our participation in the new covenant. Jesus taught the summary of the law and the new commandment. The summary of the law is that we are to love God with all our hearts, souls, and minds; and we are to love our neighbor as ourselves. The new commandment is that we are to love one another as Christ loved us. The new covenant was given by Christ to the apostles and through them to all who believe in Christ (BCP, pp. 850-851).The new covenant may be contrasted with the old covenant of God and the people of Israel. The old covenant was associated with law. However, Jeremiah (31:31-34) prophesied a coming time when God would &#8220;make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah.&#8221; This prophecy was recalled in the NT (Heb 8:6-13). The new covenant is associated with the gospel and the love of Christ that we are to share. The old covenant may be understood as preparing for or prefiguring the new covenant. God&#8217;s covenant with Abraham was understood by Christians to be fulfilled in Jesus Christ (Gal 3:16-18). A collect at the Easter Vigil (following the reading from Ez 36:24-28) recalls that God &#8220;established the new covenant of reconciliation&#8221; in the Paschal mystery (BCP, p. 290). At the Last Supper, Jesus identified the cup of wine with &#8220;the new covenant in my blood&#8221; (1 Cor 11:25; see Mt 26:28; Mk 14:24; Lk 22:20). This identification of the wine, Jesus&#8217; self-offering of his life, and the new covenant is reflected in the institution narratives of Eucharistic Prayers A, B, C, and D in Rite 2, as well as Eucharistic Prayer II of Rite 1 (see BCP, pp. 363, 368, 371, 374, 342). Bishops are called to celebrate and provide for the administration of the sacraments of the new covenant (BCP, p. 517). Similarly, priests are to minister the sacraments of the new covenant so that the reconciling love of Christ may be known and received (BCP, p. 532).

The celebrant may then say a prayer of blessing over the new fire before it is used to light the Paschal candle (BCP, p. 285). As fire is a source of warmth and light, the new fire of the Easter Vigil represents the victory in Christ of light and life over darkness and death. The Paschal candle, lighted with the new fire, symbolizes the risen Christ. After the lighting of the Paschal candle, the deacon or celebrant bears it and leads the procession to the chancel. Candles carried by the people and other lights may be lit from the Paschal candle. The Exsultet is sung or said after the Paschal candle is placed in its stand. The ceremony for blessing the new fire and the Paschal candle is derived from the primitive Lucernarium, or blessing of light, which is derived from Jewish ritual. The lighting of the new fire as a Christian ceremony may be of Celtic origin. It is mentioned in seventh-century documents concerning legends of St. Patrick. It was probably added to the Easter Vigil rite in Gaul in the eighth century through the influence of Irish monks. It was included in the Roman liturgy by the twelfth century.",

        "Newman, John Henry",
        "(Feb. 21, 1801-Aug. 11, 1890). One of the original leaders of the Oxford Movement in the nineteenth-century Church of England and subsequently a convert to Roman Catholicism. He entered Trinity College, Oxford, in June 1817 and received a B.A. in 1820. Newman became a fellow of Oriel College in 1822. He was ordained deacon in 1824 and priest in 1825. He began his ministry in 1825 as vice-principal of Alban Hall, and became vicar of St. Mary&apos;s, Oxford, in 1828. Newman wrote 24 of the Tracts for the Times, including Tract 90 (1841). In Tract 90 he attempted to reconcile the Thirty-Nine Articles with the teachings of the Council of Trent. He resigned as vicar of St. Mary&apos;s on Sept. 18, 1843. His growing doubts about the Church of England led to his becoming a Roman Catholic on Oct. 9, 1845. Pope Leo XIII made him a cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church in 1879. Newman has been recognized as a major theological figure, especially in the latter part of the twentieth century. His Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine, written shortly after he became a Roman Catholic, and Apologia pro Vita Sua (1864) set forth his reasons for becoming a Roman Catholic. Newman&apos;s Grammar of Assent (1870) developed his theological thought about religious belief. His text &#8220;Praise to the Holiest in the height&#8221; appears as Hymns 445-446 in The Hymnal 1982. The Hymnal (1940) also included his text &#8220;Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom.&#8221; He died in Rednal, near Birmingham, England. See Oxford Movement, The.",

There is no doubt that it was passed on to the church through the Council of Chalcedon in 451. It is commonly held to be based on the baptismal creed of Jerusalem, and it is often referred to as the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed. It states the full divinity of the Son, the second Person of the Trinity, in opposition to Arius. It also states the full divinity of the Holy Spirit, as denied by Macedonius. The use of the Nicene Creed in the eucharist (right after the gospel), in contrast to the use of the Apostles&apos; Creed in baptism, began in the fifth century in Antioch and became the universal practice in the church. The Nicene Creed is expressed in its original form of &#8220;We believe&#8221; in the Rite 2 eucharistic liturgy of the 1979 BCP, and this communal expression of faith is also presented as the first option in the Rite 1 eucharistic liturgy.

At the request of the British government, she agreed to be Superintendent of Female Nurses in Turkey to organize medical care for the British soldiers injured or ill during the Crimean War, 1854-1856. While in Crimea she became ill with Crimean Fever and was an invalid from 1858 until 1888. Today her illness is recognized as chronic brucellosis. Nightingale worked to improve the health of British soldiers and she promoted sanitation reform in England and India. She is recognized for her progressive thinking about nursing and hospital organization and serves as a model of compassion against physical suffering. Her major writing, Notes on Nursing: What It Is and What It Is Not (1859), went through many editions. She is also noted for her deeply mystical and pragmatic sense of spirituality.

There were three nocturns at matins on Sundays, feasts above the rank of simple feast, and in the Office of the Dead. At these times, the lessons for the first nocturn were from scripture, the lessons for the second nocturn were from patristic or historical sources, and the lessons for the third nocturn were from a homily on the day&#8217;s gospel. In the Roman Catholic Church, the number of sets of antiphons and psalms for these nocturns was set at three in 1912. There was only one nocturn at matins on simple feasts and ferial days. It had 12 psalms (later reduced to nine by Pius X), and three lessons (one from scripture, one from patristic or historical sources, and a homily). During the octaves of Easter and Pentecost, the one nocturn at matins had three psalms and three lessons.The medieval service of matins was one of the sources for the Prayer Book service of Morning Prayer.

After the abdication of James II, Archbishop Sancroft and five other bishops, along with several hundred clergy, refused to take the oath of allegiance to the new monarchs on the ground that their oath to James was irrevocable. They were joined in this action by the entire bench of Scottish bishops and a few Scottish clergy. The episcopate was imposed on the Scottish church by James I and Charles I, and the bishops were intensely loyal to the Stuart line. They would not acknowledge William and Mary as legitimate rulers of Scotland. The Church of Scotland was re-established in 1690 as Presbyterian. Both the English and Scottish groups who refused to take the oath were called nonjurors.English nonjurors were deprived of their livings and gradually declined in number and influence. The last nonjuring bishop was Charles Booth, who died in 1805.

        "Notes of the Church",
        "The Nicene Creed describes the church as one, holy, catholic, and apostolic (see BCP, pp. 358-359). These four characteristics are the notes, or marks, of the church. The church is to be &#8220;notable&#8221; or distinguishable by its unity, holiness, catholicity, and apostolicity. The Prayer Book Catechism discusses the meaning of the notes of the church (see BCP, p. 854). The church is described as one because it is one body, under one head, Jesus Christ. The church is described as holy because the Holy Spirit dwells in it, consecrating the members of the church and guiding them to do God&#8217;s work. The church is described as catholic because it proclaims the whole Christian faith to all people until the end of time. The church is described as apostolic because it continues the teaching and fellowship of the apostles, and because it is sent to carry out Christ&#8217;s mission to all people.Catholicity has also been understood in terms of the &#8220;Vincentian Canon&#8221; of Vincent of Lérins (d. before 450), who understood catholicity in terms of what has been believed everywhere, always, by all. In this regard, catholicity is understood in terms of universality, antiquity, and consent. Many Protestants have not considered the apostolic succession of bishops, passed on with ordination by laying on of hands, to be a necessary condition for catholicity and apostolicity. Many Lutherans have understood apostolicity in terms of continuity with the witness of the apostles to the gospel, rather than a succession of bishops. Other churches, including the Anglican, Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and some Lutheran churches, have upheld the necessity of an apostolic succession of bishops ordained with the laying on of hands (see the Chicago-Lambeth Quadrilateral 1886, 1888, BCP, pp. 876-878).During the sixteenth century, the notes of the church were used polemically by Roman Catholic theologians who claimed their church to be the &#8220;true&#8221; church. The notes of the church were also appealed to by the Tractarians to uphold the catholicity of the Church of England. In more recent times, the notes of the church have been understood to be both the present characteristics and the future goal of the church. In the present, the church&#8217;s unity, holiness, catholicity, and apostolicity are not yet fulfilled or perfect. But the notes of the church are already present and visible in an imperfect way. The notes of the church may become increasingly visible as the church grows in faithfulness to Christ, and manifests the authentic Christian faith more completely. The fulfillment and perfection of the notes of the church may be hoped for in terms of the eschatological coming of the kingdom of God.",

        "Oath",
        "A swearing that asserts the truth of a statement or promise, typically in the name of God. An oath is often made formally and solemnly. For example, a witness at a trial may swear that his or her testimony will be the full truth. Similarly, one who takes an oath of office swears to fulfill the duties and responsibilities of the office. The taking of oaths was criticized by Jesus, who urged in the Sermon on the Mount, &#8220;Do not swear at all,&#8221; not by heaven or the earth or Jerusalem or by one&#8217;s own head (Mt 5:33-37). This teaching is repeated in Jas 5:12. Since early Christian times, some have interpreted this teaching literally and refused to take oaths. A rigorist refusal to swear oaths was the predominant Christian attitude in the early centuries of the church. This position against oaths has been continued in modern times by Christian groups such as the Mennonites and Quakers. In many courts today, those with scruples against taking an oath are allowed to affirm (without swearing) that they will tell the truth.Others have understood the teaching against swearing to criticize the excessive or casual taking of oaths that was common when Jesus lived. Certainly, a Christian should speak the truth at all times, whether or not an oath is involved. A Christian&#8217;s word should not require an oath to be believed. An oath should be a superfluous addition to a Christian&#8217;s word. However, since the early centuries of the church, some Christians have allowed the taking of oaths in certain circumstances. Paul calls on God as his witness in several contexts (2 Cor 1:23, Gal 1:20, Phil 1:8). Augustine would allow a Christian to take an oath for a reason of great necessity, if the oath was in the interest of a great good. Article XXXIX of the Articles of Religion states that &#8220;vain and rash Swearing is forbidden Christian men by our Lord Jesus Christ, and James his Apostle,&#8221; but Christian religion does not prohibit one to swear &#8220;when the Magistrate requireth, in a cause of faith and charity, so it be done according to the Prophet&#8217;s teaching in justice, judgment, and truth&#8221; (BCP, p. 876).",

Those who refused to take this oath at the accession of William and Mary, or later George I, were known as &#8220;Nonjurors.&#8221; This oath was a conscientious stumbling block for some clergy who felt obliged to remain loyal to the crown at the time of the American Revolution. The requirement for this oath also caused Samuel Seabury to seek consecration from Scottish nonjuring bishops when he was bishop-elect of Connecticut. In 1787 Parliament passed legislation permitting the Archbishop of Canterbury to consecrate bishops for the Episcopal Church without their taking the required oath of loyalty to the English crown.",

        "1) Prayer of self-offering. Oblation is &#8220;an offering of ourselves, our lives and labors, in union with Christ, for the purposes of God&#8221; (BCP, p. 857). Christian oblation is based in Christ&apos;s one offering of himself for our salvation. The BCP states that oblation is one of the principal kinds of prayer.2) In reference to the eucharist, oblation has a broad and generic meaning as well as a narrow and technical meaning. In both cases, oblation is a kind of offering. In the broad sense, oblation refers to any offering-money, bread and wine, self, soul and body-made at the eucharist. The people&apos;s offerings are presented to the deacon or celebrant and placed on the altar for consecration (BCP, p. 361). The elements of bread and wine, consecrated at the eucharist, are identified with Christ&apos;s self-oblation. At the Last Supper, Christ identified the bread with his body and the wine with his blood of the new covenant. Christ&apos;s sacrifice is made present in the eucharist, uniting us in his one offering of himself (BCP, p. 859). The term &#8220;oblations&#8221; has at times been applied to money (alms) or other gifts that are presented at the eucharist. However, the Prayer Book rubrics distinguish the oblations of bread and wine from such other gifts. The &#8220;oblations of bread and wine&#8221; may be presented by the newly baptized or their godparents at the baptismal eucharist (BCP, p. 313), and by the persons newly confirmed at the eucharist in a service of Confirmation (BCP, p. 412). One of the offertory sentences provided by the BCP is the bidding, &#8220;Let us with gladness present the offerings and oblations of our life and labor to the Lord&#8221; (p. 377). In its more technical usage, the term refers to the section of the eucharistic prayer dealing with offering. The oblation comes after the memorial (anamnesis) and before the invocation of the Spirit (epiclesis) in eucharistic prayers A, B, and D of the 1979 BCP. For example, eucharistic Prayer D prays to God the Father, &#8220;offering to you, from the gifts you have given us, this bread and this cup, we praise you and we bless you.&#8221; This prayer of oblation immediately follows the memorial prayer, &#8220;Recalling Christ&apos;s death and his descent among the dead, proclaiming his resurrection and ascension to your right hand, awaiting his coming in glory . . .&#8221; (p. 374).

The calendar of the church year provides rules of precedence concerning principal feasts, Sundays, holy days, days of special devotion, and days of optional observance (BCP, pp. 15-18). These rules determine which feast or observance has priority. Since All Saints&apos; Day is a principal feast, it takes priority over a Sunday observance. But the Sunday observance takes priority over all feasts of apostles such as Saint Andrew the Apostle. When a feast of our Lord or other major feast appointed on a fixed day in the calendar cannot be observed because it occurs on a Sunday, the feast is normally transferred to the first convenient open day in the following week.

In the Prayer Book offices of Morning and Evening Prayer, the office hymn is typically sung after the collects, where the rubrics permit the singing of a hymn or anthem (BCP, pp. 58, 71, 101, 125). A suitable office hymn may also be substituted for the Phos hilaron at Evening Prayer (BCP, pp. 64, 118).

In 1729 Oglethorpe presided over a committee which brought about much-needed reforms in the prison system. From this experience came the idea of founding a new colony in North America. This new colony was to be a place where poor and unemployed debtors could start afresh, and where persecuted Protestant groups could find refuge. In 1732 Oglethorpe and 19 associates received a charter naming them &#8220;Trustees for establishing the colony of Georgia in America.&#8221; The colony was named for King George II. The next year, 1733, Oglethorpe brought 116 debtors to Georgia, and founded Savannah. In 1738, with the outbreak of war with Spain, he conducted a vigorous defense of the colony. His campaign to capture the Spanish settlement of St. Augustine was unsuccessful. In 1743 Oglethorpe returned to England and resumed his parliamentary career as a social reformer.

        "Oil, Holy",
        "Olive oil that has been blessed is used sacramentally in the liturgical and pastoral ministries of the church. Holy oil is usually applied by the minister of the sacrament or sacramental rite to the forehead of the one who is anointed. The minister often applies the oil with the thumb, making the sign of the cross with the oil. Historically, three types of oil have been identified for use in liturgical anointing. Chrism, a mixture of olive oil and fragrant balsam, is used for the anointing after baptism. It has been abbreviated &#8220;SC,&#8221; sanctum chrisma. Chrism may also be used at Confirmation. It has also been used to anoint newly consecrated bishops. The oil of catechumens was pure olive oil. It was used for the exorcistic anointing prior to baptism. It has also been used at the ordination of priests and the anointing of kings. It was abbreviated &#8220;OC,&#8221; oleum catechumenorum. The oil of the sick was also pure olive oil. It was used for anointing the sick. It was abbreviated &#8220;OI,&#8221; oleum infirmorum.In the OT, oil was used for anointing kings and priests (see 1 Sm 10:1 and 16:1, 13; Ex 29:7). The use of oil in Christian baptism dates from at least the second century. The title &#8220;Christ&#8221; means the &#8220;anointed one.&#8221; Oil is used as a symbol of baptism in the NT (see Lk 4:18, Acts 4:27, 1 Jn 2:20, 27). The NT also records the practice of anointing with oil for healing (see Mk 6:13, Jas 5:14). The Apostolic Tradition of Hippolytus (c. 215) included a form for the blessing of oil for the sick. The Apostolic Tradition also noted that anointing with oil was not required for baptism if oil were unavailable. By the fourth or early fifth century, it was required that chrism be consecrated by a bishop. The 1979 BCP (p. 307) calls for chrism to be consecrated by the bishop. This may be done when the bishop is present in the parish for Confirmation (BCP, p. 419). The BOS provides a form for Consecration of Chrism apart from Baptism. This rite takes place immediately after the postcommunion prayer and before the bishop&apos;s blessing and the dismissal. In many dioceses, the consecration of chrism by the bishop may be done at a service of reaffirmation of ordination vows during Holy Week. The BCP allows oil for the anointing of the sick to be blessed by a priest or bishop (p. 455). The Prayer Book does not mention the Oil of Catechumens. The use of oil was rejected by many churches at the time of the Reformation. The 1549 BCP included a post-baptismal anointing, but this anointing was not present in the 1552 Prayer Book. The 1549 Prayer Book allowed the use of oil if the sick person desired to be anointed. But the 1549 BCP did not provide a form for setting apart the oil for this use. This use of oil was also eliminated in the 1552 BCP. The 1928 BCP restored the practice of anointing. It provided a form for &#8220;Unction of the Sick.&#8221; The 1928 Prayer Book did not provide a form for blessing the oil, and it allowed no use of oil in addition to the anointing of the sick. The 1979 BCP includes the rite of chrismation at baptism (p. 308). The Prayer Book directs that the bishop or priest will mark the sign of the cross on the forehead of the newly baptized person, using chrism if desired (BCP, p. 308). The Prayer Book Catechism states that unction is the rite of anointing the sick with oil, or the laying on of hands, by which God&apos;s grace is given for the healing of spirit, mind, and body (BCP, p. 861). The Prayer Book service for Ministration to the Sick includes Part I, ministry of the word, Part II, laying on of hands and anointing, and Part III, Holy Communion (BCP, pp. 453-457). If the sick person is to be anointed, the priest dips a thumb in the holy oil and makes the sign of the cross on the sick person&apos;s forehead (BCP, p. 456). In cases of necessity, a deacon or lay person may perform the anointing with oil blessed by a bishop or priest. The BOS also provides a form for a Public Service of Healing. At this service the celebrant lays hands on the people, and may anoint the people with oil of the sick. Olive oil may be one of the gifts presented to the new minister at the Celebration of a New Ministry. When the oil is presented, the new minister is urged to be among the members of the congregation &#8220;as a healer and reconciler&#8221; (BCP, p. 561).",

Other versions include the apocryphal books in a separate section of the Bible. In recent years the term &#8220;Hebrew Scriptures&#8221; has been used frequently for the first part of the Bible. The practice presumably reflects the concern that the adjective &#8220;old&#8221; might seem pejorative and imply that the NT has invalidated the OT, which would be offensive to Jewish people. The Hebrew Bible itself consists of the thirty-nine books of the Protestant Bible but in a different order. It has three divisions: 1) the Pentateuch (or Torah); 2) the Prophets (or Nebiim), divided into the Former and the Latter Prophets; and 3) the Writings (Kethubim). This seems to be the order in which the three were accepted as authoritative by the Jewish community. The term &#8220;testament&#8221; comes from the Latin translation of the Hebrew word berith, which means &#8220;covenant.&#8221; Thus the two parts of the Christian Bible refer basically to the two covenants of biblical times, the first with the Hebrew people and the second with the Christian community.

The canon, &#8220;Of persons Not Ministers in this Church Officiating in any Congregation Thereof,&#8221; forbade this. The 1907 General Convention amended this canon to allow Episcopal clergy to invite clergy from other churches to speak in Episcopal churches. Part of the canon stated that nothing should &#8220;prevent the Bishop of any Diocese or Missionary District from giving permission to Christian men, who are not Ministers of the Church, to make addresses in the Church, or special occasions.&#8221; It became known as the &#8220;open pulpit&#8221; canon and caused considerable controversy in the church. In reaction to this canon, William McGarvey, one of the founders of the Companions of the Holy Saviour, renounced his Episcopal orders and joined the Roman Catholic Church along with some other priests and Nashotah House students.",

The BCP also provides orders for eucharist (pp. 400-405), marriage (pp. 435-436), and burial (pp. 506-507). These &#8220;orders&#8221; are often used as alternate services for pastoral reasons or special occasions instead of other liturgical forms. For example, &#8220;An Order for Celebrating the Holy Eucharist&#8221; (known by some as &#8220;Rite 3&#8221;) is &#8220;not intended for use at the principal Sunday or weekly celebration of the Holy Eucharist&#8221; (BCP, p. 400). These orders insure the basic form of the church&#8217;s liturgy in these services, while allowing enhanced flexibility to those who plan and participate in the service.2) Concerning the forms of ministry in the church. The ministers of the church are lay persons, bishops, priests, and deacons (BCP, p. 855). In a &#8220;vote by orders&#8221; in the House of Deputies of the General Convention, or in a diocesan convention, the votes of clergy and lay orders are counted separately. All baptized persons are members of the church and called to ministry. Some members of the church are ordained as bishops, priests, and deacons. These members of the church are in &#8220;holy orders.&#8221;3) A religious order is a society whose members voluntarily commit themselves for life or a term of years to holding their possessions in common or in trust and to living a celibate life in community in obedience to the rule and constitution of the religious order.

        "Order of Worship for the Evening, An",
        "A form of evening service or vespers for use in the late afternoon or evening. It may be used as a complete rite instead of Evening Prayer, or as the introduction to Evening Prayer or another service, or as the prelude to an evening meal or other activity. It may also be used in private homes (BCP, p. 108). The historic roots of this service may be traced to the ritual blessing of light by Jews at the evening meal. This Jewish custom was continued in the ancient evening services of early Christians. This evening service included a blessing of light (lucernarium), a selection from the Psalter, and prayers. It could also include an agap&apos; meal. Although this service continued in Eastern Orthodoxy, it disappeared in much of western Christianity as the monastic hours of prayer replaced the ancient congregational daily services (also known as cathedral offices). The 1979 BCP is the first Prayer Book to include this service.At the opening of An Order of Worship for the Evening, the ministers enter a darkened church. The ministers may be preceded by one or two lighted candles. During Easter season, the Paschal candle is burning as the service begins. The officiant approaches the lighted Paschal candle and begins the service by its light. A short lesson of scripture may follow the opening acclamation. This lesson is optional. The officiant then says the Prayer for Light, using one of the forms in the rite or another suitable prayer. After the Prayer for Light, the altar candles are lighted, along with other candles and lamps. In Easter season, the candles are lighted from the Paschal candle. An appropriate anthem or psalm may be sung during the candle-lighting, or silence may be kept. The BOS provides a variety of anthems (lucernaria) for optional use at the candle-lighting. After the candle-lighting, there follows the singing of the Phos hilaron, or a metrical version of it, or another hymn. Incense may be used after the candle-lighting and while the Phos hilaron is sung (BCP, p. 143). The service may then continue with Evening Prayer, or the Holy Eucharist, or another office or devotion. The BCP directs that the Service of Light of this liturgy is to begin a Vigil of Pentecost (p. 227). In the BOS, this Service of Light is also used to begin a Vigil for Christmas Eve, a Service for New Year&apos;s Eve, a Vigil for the Eve of the Baptism of Our Lord, a Vigil for the Eve of All Saints&apos; Day or the Sunday after All Saints&apos; Day, a Service for All Hallows&apos; Eve, and a Vigil on the Eve of Baptism. The Service of Light may also be used to introduce Advent and Christmas Festivals of Lessons and Music if these festivals take place in the evening. The service may be followed by a meal or other activity, with the Phos hilaron followed by the Lord&apos;s Prayer and a grace or blessing. The service may also continue as a complete evening office. The Phos hilaron is then followed by a selection from the Psalter; a Bible reading which may be followed by a sermon or homily, a passage from Christian literature, or a brief silence; a canticle (which may be the Magnificat,  the traditional evening canticle, or another canticle) or hymn of praise; prayers, including the Lord&apos;s Prayer and possibly the collect of the day, or a collect proper to the season, or one of the prayers included in the rite, or one of the collects from. The Aaronic blessing in a threefold form (based on Nm 6:24-26) is provided in the as an option for the concluding blessing. A blessing over food may conclude the service when a meal is to follow. ",

Ordinary time includes the Monday after the Feast of the Baptism of our Lord through the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday, and the Monday after Pentecost through the Saturday before the First Sunday of Advent. A vigil or other service anticipating the First Sunday of Advent on the Saturday before that Sunday would also be included in the season of Advent. Ordinary time can be understood in terms of the living out of Christian faith and the meaning of Christ&#8217;s resurrection in ordinary life. The term &#8220;ordinary time&#8221; is not used in the Prayer Book, but the season after Pentecost can be considered ordinary time. It may be referred to as the &#8220;green season,&#8221; because green is the usual liturgical color for this period of the church year. The BCP provides numbered propers with collects and lectionary readings for the Sundays of the Season after Pentecost. The Epiphany season includes the Epiphany, the First Sunday after the Epiphany: the Baptism of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Second Sunday through the Last Sunday after the Epiphany (BCP, p. 31). In view of the Epiphany themes that are presented throughout the Epiphany season, it should not be considered ordinary time. However, many parishes use green as the liturgical color for the Second Sunday through the Sunday prior to the Last Sunday after the Epiphany, and sometimes the Last Sunday after the Epiphany. Epiphany season and the season after Pentecost vary in length depending on the date of Easter (see BCP, pp. 884-885).",

        "Ordination",
        "A sacramental rite of the church by which God gives authority and the grace of the Holy Spirit through prayer and the laying on of hands by bishops to those being made bishops, priests, and deacons (BCP, pp. 860-861). The three distinct orders of bishops, priests, and deacons have been characteristic of Christ&#8217;s holy catholic church. Bishops carry on the apostolic work of leading, supervising, and uniting the church. Presbyters (often known as priests) are associated with bishops in the ministry of church governance, along with the church&#8217;s ministry of missionary and pastoral work, in preaching of the Word of God, and in the administration of the sacraments. Deacons assist bishops and priests in all of this work, and have special responsibility to minister in Christ&#8217;s name to the poor, the sick, the suffering, and the helpless (BCP, p. 510). The BCP provides rites for the ordination of bishops (p. 512), priests (p. 525), and deacons (p. 537). The earliest known text of ordination rites is in the Apostolic Tradition of Hippolytus (c. 215). The 1549 BCP did not include ordination rites. &#8220;The Form and Manner of Making and Consecrating of Archbishops, Bishops, Priests, and Deacons&#8221; was published in 1550. Rites for ordination were included in many subsequent revisions of the Prayer Book. The Preface to the Ordination Rites of the Prayer Book notes that the church intends to maintain and continue the three orders of bishops, priests, and deacons. The ordination services are therefore appointed by the church. No person is to exercise the office of bishop, priest, or deacon unless he or she has been ordained. The manner of ordination in the Episcopal Church has been generally recognized by Christian people as suitable for conferring the sacred orders of bishop, priest, and deacon.The services of ordination include a presentation of the ordinand to the ordaining bishop or bishops; the ordinand&#8217;s Declaration of Consent that states his or her belief in the scriptures and conformity to the doctrine, discipline, and worship of the Episcopal Church; the people&#8217;s consent to the ordination and their promise to uphold the ordinand in the new ministry; the Litany for Ordinations (BCP, pp. 548-551); lessons and sermon; the examination of the candidate; the singing of the hymn &#8220;Veni Creator Spiritus&#8221; or &#8220;Veni Sancte Spiritus&#8221;; a period of silent prayer; the prayer of consecration and laying on of hands by the ordaining bishop or bishops; vesting of the newly ordained person according to the new order of ministry; and participation in the eucharist by the newly ordained person in ways that are appropriate to his or her order of ministry. At the ordination of a bishop, the Presiding Bishop and at least two other bishops lay their hands on the ordinand&#8217;s head. At the ordination of a priest, the bishop is joined by priests in the laying on of hands. Only the bishop lays hands on the head of the ordinand at the ordination of a deacon. The bishop-elect leads the Creed at the ordination of a bishop after the Examination. The Creed precedes the Examination at the ordination of a priest or a deacon. The newly ordained bishop is the chief celebrant at the eucharist. The newly ordained priest joins in the celebration of the eucharist with the bishop and other presbyters. The newly ordained deacon may prepare the Lord&#8217;s table and dismiss the people at the eucharist.In the Episcopal Church the ordained ministry is normally seen as a life-long vocation. Careful selection, discernment, and preparation are required before ordination takes place. The canons call for theological instruction in the Holy Scriptures; church history, including the ecumenical movement; Christian theology; Christian ethics and moral theology; studies in contemporary society, including racial and minority groups; liturgics and church music; and theory and practice of ministry. The requirements and standards of learning may be modified in the ordination of local priests and deacons. The BOS provides a form for the Reaffirmation of Ordination Vows.",

Similar resolutions had been narrowly defeated at the 1970 and 1973 General Conventions. A 1967 General Convention resolution had opened the diaconate to women and recognized that women currently serving as deaconesses were members of the diaconate. On July 29, 1974, three bishops, claiming that &#8220;obedience to the Spirit&#8221; justified their action, ordained eleven women deacons to the priesthood. The ensuing controversy surrounding these irregular ordinations highlighted divisions evident in the church over this issue. After the 1976 vote, most dioceses accepted the ordination of women, and ordinations of women proceeded at a rapid rate. The 1997 General Convention revised the canons to prevent any diocese from denying access to the ordination process, or refusing to license a member of the clergy to officiate, solely on the grounds of gender.

        "The shared sinful condition of all humanity. This Christian doctrine is drawn from the Pauline writings, such as Rom 5:12-19 and 1 Cor 15:21-22, which suggest that humanity shares by nature in the fall of Adam described in Gn 3. Paul likewise urges that the consequences for humanity of Adam&#8217;s fall are to be reversed through saving participation in Christ&#8217;s victory over sin and death.Original sin has been described as &#8220;hereditary sin.&#8221; Augustine understood original sin to be transmitted through sexual intercourse leading to conception. This understanding contributed to negative attitudes concerning human sexuality on the part of some Christians.Luther&#8217;s understanding of original sin led him to emphasize humanity&#8217;s utter dependence on God&#8217;s grace and the need for faith. Calvinism came to emphasize humanity&#8217;s total depravity relative to original sin. Although the consequences of original sin have not been emphasized as strongly in Anglicanism as in other Protestant traditions, Article IX of the Articles of Religion, &#8220;Of Original or Birth-Sin,&#8221; states that &#8220;man is very far gone from original righteousness, and is of his own nature inclined to evil&#8221; (BCP, p. 869). Roman Catholics likewise identify the consequence of original sin as a fall from grace or a wounded human nature rather than a corrupt nature.Original sin may be understood as humanity&#8217;s innate self-centeredness. A consequence of this condition is human weakness and fallibility relative to sin. Another consequence is the influence of human sinfulness in our history and environment, to which we are subjected from birth. These influences all serve to restrict the actual freedom of moral choices, requiring us to look to God for hope and salvation.",

        "Ornaments, Church",
        "Items of symbolic or decorative value in church, such as an altar cross, a processional cross, and altar candles. There was considerable controversy in the Episcopal Church during the latter part of the nineteenth century concerning the use of church ornaments and other ritual or ceremonial practices such as genuflections and the use of incense. Canons on ritual were debated at the 1871 and 1874 General Conventions. James DeKoven was a delegate to the 1871 and 1874 General Conventions and a leading defender of ritualism. He argued that practices such as altar lights, genuflections, and the use of incense symbolize the real, spiritual presence of Christ. DeKoven believed that these practices do not symbolize the doctrine of transubstantiation, as feared by the opponents of ritualism. At the 1874 General Convention, DeKoven was an advocate for comprehensiveness and tolerance in worship. Although a canon on ritual was ultimately passed, it was seldom enforced. In many respects, DeKoven&apos;s comprehensive vision of worship was the view that prevailed in the Episcopal Church. Church ornaments such as altar crosses and altar candles are present in virtually all Episcopal churches. The Prayer Book form for the Dedication and Consecration of a Church includes a general prayer of dedication for ornaments or furnishings (BCP, p. 573). The BOS provides specific forms for the dedication of a variety of church furnishings and ornaments, including forms for a cross, candlesticks and lamps, a service book, pictures and statues, a vessel for incense, and any church ornament.",

        "Oxford Movement, The",
        "A nineteenth-century movement which reasserted the apostolic and catholic heritage of Anglicanism. The Oxford Movement is also known as the Catholic Revival. It emphasized the church&#8217;s identity as the divine society and the sacramental character of the church&#8217;s corporate life. It also sought to uphold the BCP as the rule of faith. It began when several priests of the Church of England, most notably Edward Pusey, John Henry Newman, and John Keble, became convinced that the Church of England had abandoned its heritage as a catholic and apostolic church. They feared that the Church of England was in danger of apostasy. The immediate beginning of the Oxford Movement was a sermon preached by Keble in 1833 in which he denied the authority of the British Parliament to abolish several dioceses in Ireland.Keble, Pusey, Newman, and others began to publish a series known as Tracts for the Times, which called the Church of England to return to the ways of the ancient and undivided church in matters of doctrine, liturgy and devotion. The Tracts were a powerful and influential expression of the principles of the Oxford Movement, and the Oxford Movement has also been known as the Tractarian Movement. The writers of the Tracts and their supporters have been known as Tractarians. The Tracts were strongly opposed to the abuses which they saw in the Roman Catholic Church, but they were attacked as &#8220;papist&#8221; and rejected by many. However, many others were convinced by the Tracts, and the Oxford Movement became a major force in the Church of England. The leaders of the Oxford Movement taught that the Church of England and the larger Anglican Communion are part of the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic church. The last Tract was Newman&#8217;s Tract 90(1841), which generally sought to interpret the Thirty-Nine Articles as consistent with the decrees of the Roman Catholic Council of Trent (1545-1563). This prompted considerable criticism and ended the publication of Tracts. The movement faced a crisis when Newman and others subsequently left the Church of England to become Roman Catholics. The Oxford Movement survived this crisis through the work of Pusey, Keble, Robert Wilberforce, and a second generation of priests, known as the ritualists, who worked among the poor in the large cities of Britain.The Oxford Movement encouraged a recovery of the beauty of the church&#8217;s worship in the external forms of liturgical ceremonies, vestments, and music. It led to a renewed appreciation for the church&#8217;s catholic heritage and tradition, the importance of the apostolic ministry and the sacraments, the recovery of Anglican spiritual life, the revival of monastic life in the Anglican Communion, and appreciation for the ancient doctrines, discipline, and devotional practices of the church. It inspired the Library of the Fathers, which included English translations of patristic works. The first volume was Pusey&#8217;s translation of Augustine&#8217;s Confessions (1838), with a preface by Pusey on the significance of patristic study. The movement also led to the liberal catholic movement at the end of the nineteenth century.In the United States, the Oxford Movement had considerable impact, although many of its theological principles had been earlier anticipated. Many Tractarian parishes were established throughout the United States, especially in the midwest where Nashotah House in Wisconsin was influential. As in England, the movement led to many controversies in the Episcopal Church. There was an investigation of the General Theological Seminary in New York. General Convention passed an anti-ritualist canon. James DeKoven was denied episcopal election, and a few people followed Newman to the Roman Catholic Church. But the controversies eventually quieted down in the United States as in England, and many of the principles of the Oxford Movement have become widely accepted in the Episcopal Church.

        "Pacifism",
        "The renunciation of the use of violent force that would take the life of another person. The early Christian community was of two minds whether a Christian could be a soldier. On the one hand, Jesus&apos; positive appraisal of the faith of the centurion (Lk 7:9) and the acceptance of civil authority, specifically the military, in Romans (13:4) and in 1 Peter (2:14), served as warrant for the just use of force. This came to be developed as the just war theory. On the other hand, Jesus was believed to have rejected the use of force in his teaching. This was seen, for example, in Jesus&apos; teaching to &#8220;turn the other cheek&#8221; (Lk 6:29; Mt 5:39). Jesus&apos; opposition to the use of force was also seen in his life, in the rebuke of Peter&apos;s drawing of the sword (Jn 18:10-11), and in his willing acceptance of his own crucifixion. By the fourth century, with the spread of Christianity throughout the Roman Empire, the end of Christian persecution, and the establishment of Christianity as the state religion, pacifism was assumed largely by the monastic movements. The renunciation of force was believed to be a higher way of life. The Reformation gave rise to pacifist Anabaptist groups which have continued to the present. These include, most notably, the historic &#8220;peace churches&#8221;-Quakers, Mennonites, and Brethren. While Christian pacifism has historically been grounded in an absolute prohibition against the use of force, three other kinds of pacifism have developed: pragmatic, technological, and vocational. Pragmatic pacifists believe that non-violent suffering can bring about the end of violence. Technological pacifists believe that pacifism is required in opposing modern war because of the threat such war poses to all creation. Vocational pacifists believe that the renunciation of violence is not a universal obligation but a specific calling that bears witness to the larger ends of God. In Anglicanism, pacifism has generally been rejected except as vocational witness. See Episcopal Peace Fellowship, The (EPF).",

        "Palm Sunday (The Sunday of the Passion)",
        "The Sunday before Easter at which Jesus&#8217; triumphal entry into Jerusalem (Mt 21:1-11, Mk 11:1-11a, Lk 19:29-40) and Jesus&#8217; Passion on the cross (Mt 26:36-27:66, Mk 14:32-15:47, Lk 22:39-23:56) are recalled. It is also known as the Sunday of the Passion. Palm Sunday is the first day of Holy Week. Red is the liturgical color for the day. The observance of Palm Sunday in Jerusalem was witnessed by the pilgrim Egeria in about 381-384. During this observance there was a procession of people down the Mount of Olives into Jerusalem. The people waved branches of palms or olive trees as they walked. They sang psalms, including Ps 118, and shouted the antiphon, &#8220;Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!&#8221; The Palm Sunday observance was generally accepted throughout the church by the twelfth century. However, the day was identified in the 1549 BCP as simply &#8220;The Sunday next before Easter.&#8221; The blessing of branches and the procession were not included. The 1928 BCP added the phrase &#8220;commonly called Palm Sunday&#8221; to the title of the day. A form for blessing palms was provided by the Book of Offices (1960). The 1979 BCP presents the full title for the day, &#8220;The Sunday of the Passion: Palm Sunday&#8221; (BCP, p. 270). The liturgy of the palms is the entrance rite for the service. The congregation may gather at a place apart from the church and process to the church after the blessing of the branches of palm or other trees (BCP, p. 270). The liturgy of the palms includes a reading of one of the gospel accounts of Jesus&#8217; entrance into Jerusalem. The branches may be distributed to the people before the service or after the prayer of blessing. All the people hold branches in their hands during the procession. Appropriate hymns, psalms, or anthems are sung. The Prayer Book notes that the hymn &#8220;All glory, laud, and honor&#8221; (Hymns 154-155) and Ps 118:19-29 may be used (BCP, p. 271). The Hymnal 1982 also provides &#8220;Ride on! ride on in majesty!&#8221; (Hymn 156) and &#8220;Hosanna in the highest&#8221; (Hymn 157) for the procession at the liturgy of the palms. The Hymnal 1982 provides musical settings for the opening anthem, the blessing over the branches, and the bidding for the procession (Hymn 153). The procession may halt for a station at an appropriate place such as the church door. The BCP provides a stational collect which may be used (p. 272). The palm liturgy may be led by a deacon or lay reader if a bishop or priest is unavailable.When the service includes the eucharist, the liturgy of the palms is followed by the salutation and the collect of the day. The service changes focus abruptly from the triumphal entry into Jerusalem to the solemnity of the Passion. In the 1979 BCP, the Passion gospel is drawn from one of the three synoptic accounts of the Passion, one of which is appointed for each of the three years in the eucharistic lectionary. The Passion gospel is announced simply, &#8220;The Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ according to _________.&#8221; The customary responses before and after the gospel are omitted (BCP, p. 272). The Passion gospel may be read or chanted by lay persons. Specific roles may be assigned to different persons, with the congregation taking the part of the crowd (BCP, p. 273). It is customary to observe a brief time of silence when the moment of Jesus&#8217; death is described by the narrator. The Hymnal 1982 provides a variety of hymns concerning the Passion, including &#8220;Sing, my tongue, the glorious battle&#8221; (Hymns 165-166), &#8220;O sacred head, sore wounded&#8221; (Hymns 168-169), and &#8220;Were you there when they crucified my Lord?&#8221; (Hymn 172).",

        "(Aug. 6, 1504-May 17, 1575). The first Archbishop of Canterbury under Queen Elizabeth. Parker was responsible for enacting and enforcing the Elizabethan Settlement. He studied at St. Mary&apos;s Hostel, Cambridge University. He received his B.A. in 1527, his M.A. in 1528, his B.D. in 1535, and his D.D. in 1537, all from Corpus Christi College, Cambridge University. He was ordained deacon on Apr. 20, 1527, and priest on June 15, 1527. While at Cambridge he belonged to a group called the &#8220;Cambridge Reformers,&#8221; who helped to bring the Reformation to England. At first Parker was attracted to the teachings of Martin Luther, but then moved away from Luther as he studied more deeply the patristic literature. He supported the publication of The Institute of a Christian Man (1537), known as the Bishops&apos; Book, which was a commentary on the Ten Articles. The Ten Articles were Henry VIII&apos;s greatest concessions to the Protestants. Martin Bucer, the reformer at Strasburg, was regius professor of divinity at Cambridge, 1549-1551, and had a great influence on Parker. Bucer represented a moderating position between Ulrich Zwingli and Martin Luther. Parker was chaplain to Anne Boleyn, 1535-1536. He served as dean of the College of St. John the Baptist, Stoke-by-Clare, Suffolk, 1535-1547. He was rector of Ashen (Ashdon), 1542-1544. Parker was master and vice-chancellor, Corpus Christi College, 1544-1552. He was dean of Lincoln Cathedral, 1552-1553. On Dec. 17, 1559, Parker was consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury and served in that position until his death. His primacy was one of the most important in the history of the English Church. He had to work between the extremes of the Marian party, which wanted to restore the Church of England to Roman obedience and medieval theology, and the extreme reforming party, at first called &#8220;precisionists,&#8221; and then Puritans, who wanted aggressive reforms in the Church of England with regard to ceremonial and theology. Parker&apos;s great success was to steer the Church of England between these two extremes, and it has been suggested that he originated the via media, which is the primary characteristic of Anglicanism. He was evangelical but conservative, and catholic but reformed. He applied the broad principles of the Reformation to the Church of England without betraying the catholicity of the church. Under Parker&apos;s leadership, the &#8220;42 Articles&#8221; were revised and issued in 1563, and published in 1571 as the &#8220;39 Articles.&#8221; He supervised the translation of the &#8220;Bishops&apos; Bible,&#8221; which was published in 1568, and which superseded Tyndale&apos;s translation and the &#8220;Geneva Bible&#8221; of 1560. It remained the official English version until the publication of the Authorized Version in 1611. Parker died in London.",

It is customary for the Paschal candle to burn at all services from Easter through Pentecost (BCP, pp. 285-287).After the Easter season, the Paschal candle is typically placed near the font. It should burn at baptisms, representing the new life in Christ that we share in baptism. The newly baptized person may be given a small baptismal candle that is lit from the Paschal candle.

Paschal means pertaining to Easter (the Pascha) and to its antecedent the Hebrew Passover. The Passover has the promise of redemption and the gift of freedom at the Red Sea. In the NT, the Paschal concept includes Jesus&apos; death and resurrection, the ascension and gift of the Holy Spirit, baptism, the calling of a new people from every nation and language, and participation in the mystery through eating and drinking with our Risen Lord. The creation enhances our sense of the Paschal Mystery with the gift of light (including the Paschal full moon), with the beauty and wonder of nature, and our own creation in God&apos;s image (and in the northern hemisphere, the arrival of Spring). These meanings are drawn together in the Great Vigil of Easter, the most comprehensive and dramatic liturgy of the church (BCP, pp. 284-295).

        "Pastor, Pastoral Ministry",
        "The word &#8220;pastor&#8221; derives from the work of tending sheep: a pastor is one who cares for sheep. The term came into the Christian understanding of the ordained ministry because of the frequent references in Holy Scripture to God as a shepherd of the people of Israel and Jesus as the Good Shepherd. A priest is a pastor for his or her congregation in the sense that he or she cares for the people, protects them and directs them, and feeds them with spiritual food in the Holy Eucharist. Similarly, a bishop is a chief pastor because she or he has oversight of all those pastors who care for the people committed to their care. There are certain ambiguities in the term now that the church is much less agrarian and rural than in previous times. But the term &#8220;pastor&#8221; and the related work of pastoral ministry are deeply important for the Christian tradition of ordained ministry.The work of pastoral care has always been deeply important in Anglicanism. It has been seen as the first work of the parish priest and of the bishop in a diocese. There have been times when pastoral care has been neglected on a wide scale. Those times have in turn provoked a demand among Christian people for a revival of pastoral care, as in the Wesleyan and evangelical revivals of the eighteenth century and the catholic revival of the nineteenth century. Each of those revivals has resulted from a sense that the church and the ordained ministry of the church have the care of God&#8217;s people as their first responsibility, even while the form of that care may vary in time and place.In the church today pastoral care takes many different forms. For example, spiritual direction and pastoral counseling are both specialized forms of pastoral care that require specific training and responsibility. In the Episcopal Church there is great interest in enhancing the pastoral work of the bishops of the church for both the clergy and lay people of their dioceses. There is also great interest in developing the ministry of the laity for pastoral care.",

Patristic sources provide the basis for the fundamental orthodoxy of Christian belief.

These Doctors of the Church in the patristic age included Basil the Great, Gregory of Nazianzus, John Chrysostom, and Athanasius in the east; and Ambrose, Augustine, Jerome, and Gregory the Great in the west. Traditional Anglican reverence for the patristic age was renewed by the Oxford Movement in the nineteenth century.

        "(d. c. 64). Apostle to the Gentiles, author of several NT epistles, preeminent Christian missionary. He was originally named Saul. He was a Jew of the Diaspora, a member of the tribe of Benjamin, and a native of Tarsus in Cilicia. He spoke and wrote in Greek. Saul held Roman citizenship from birth, and his trade was tent-making. He was trained in rhetoric and educated in Jerusalem at the feet of Gamaliel, a Pharisaic member of the Jewish Sanhedrin (Acts 22:3).Saul was a zealous Pharisee and a persecutor of the Christian church (Gal 1:13, 1 Cor 15:9, Phil 3:6). He was present and approving when Stephen was martyred (Acts 7:58). After Stephen&#8217;s death, Saul &#8220;ravaged&#8221; the church, dragging off men and women whom he committed to prison (Acts 8:3). He went to Damascus with authority from the Sanhedrin to persecute the Christian church, but he was converted to Christ on the way (Acts 9:1-22). His conversion has been dated at about 34 A.D. A light from heaven flashed around Saul and he heard the voice of Jesus asking &#8220;Why do you persecute me?&#8221; He subsequently recalled that Jesus had appeared to him (1 Cor 9:1, 15:8), and he viewed this experience as authority for his apostolic ministry (Gal 1:15-17). Saul was without sight for a time after this vision, and he was led to Damascus by those who were with him. The disciple Ananias was directed by a vision to baptize him. Ananias was reluctant to baptize Saul, but the Lord told him that he had chosen Saul to bring his name &#8220;before Gentiles and kings and before the people of Israel.&#8221; The Conversion of St. Paul the Apostle is celebrated on Jan. 25 in the Episcopal calendar of the church year.After baptism, Saul confounded the Jews in Damascus by proving that Jesus was the Messiah. Saul attempted to join the disciples in Jerusalem, but they were afraid of him because they did not believe he was a disciple. Barnabas brought him to the apostles, and described Saul&#8217;s conversion experience (Acts 9:26-27). Saul was accepted as a Christian disciple. Saul and Barnabas were subsequently commissioned by the church at Antioch for missionary work. Barnabas and Saul set off upon what was to be the first of Paul&#8217;s three missionary journeys. It was from the time of this first missionary journey that Saul was known as Paul. He founded churches in Asia Minor and Greece, and he wrote public letters or epistles to these churches. Paul made three missionary journeys (Acts 13-14, 15:40-18:22, 18:23-21:17). Paul was accompanied on his second missionary journey by Silas (Silvanus), and later Timothy. Paul and Barnabas went separate ways because Barnabas wanted to take John (Mark) with them, but Paul felt that Mark had deserted them in Pamphylia on the first missionary journey (Acts 15:36-40, 16:3). When the Jews at Corinth opposed and reviled Paul on his second missionary journey, he declared that &#8220;From now on I will go to the Gentiles&#8221; (Acts 18:6). He also collected money for the Christians in Jerusalem (see Acts 11:29-30; 1 Cor 16:1-4).Paul went to Jerusalem at the end of his third missionary journey despite warnings about what might happen to him. Paul was arrested by the Roman tribune after a riot broke out over Paul&#8217;s presence in Jerusalem. He was transferred to Caesarea, where he was held for two years. When a new governor was going to return Paul to Jerusalem for trial, he appealed to the emperor and was transferred to Rome. He was shipwrecked at Malta, but finally arrived safely in Rome. Paul was allowed to live by himself for two years with the soldier who was guarding him. Paul explained the Christian faith to the Jews at Rome. Some were convinced by him, but others refused to believe. Paul proclaimed to them that the salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles (Acts 28:17-30). There is no mention of Paul&#8217;s death in Acts. Paul is believed to have been martyred in Rome under the Emperor Nero around A.D. 64.Paul&#8217;s epistles to the Christian communities represent a significant portion of the NT. His letters are primarily sources for understanding his career, along with the secondary source provided bu the Book of Acts. These letters dealt with theological, ethical, and pastoral problems that the Christian communities were facing. Most scholars acknowledge that Paul authored Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, 1 Thessalonians, Philippians, Colossians and Philemon. Others also acknowledge that Paul authored 2 Thessalonians, Ephesians, 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus. Some variations in style may be explained by the fact that secretaries assisted Paul in composing these epistles. Paul&#8217;s theology emphasized the importance of salvation though faith in Christ rather than works of the law. Paul,the Apostle to the Gentiles, resisted the requirement that Gentile converts be conformed to the Jewish Law (see Phil 3:2-11). Paul and Barnabas influences the apostles and elders in Jerusalem not to require circumcision of Gentile converts to Christianity (Acts 15:1-29; Gal 2:1-10. Paul even rebuked Peter when Peter would not eat with Gentiles (Gal 2:11-14. Paul urged, &#8220;We know that a person is justified not by works of the law but through the faith in Jesus Christ&#8221; (Gal 2:16). Paul provoked the outrage of Jewish authorities against him, and his teaching influenced the early separation of the Christian church from Judaism.Paul&#8217;s writings have been foundational for Christian theology of salvation, the Christ, the church, the Spirit, and the end times. Paul emphasized the reality of salvation in Christ, whose life, death, and resurrection we may share in the church though baptism (see Rom 6:3-5). As all die in Adam, so shall all be made alive in Christ (1 Cor 15:22; see Rom 5:18). God has reconciled us to himself in Christ. Anyone who is in Christ is a new creation (2 Cor 5:17-18). The new age has been inaugurated by Jesus&#8217; resurrection. Christ is the &#8220;first fruits&#8221; of the resurrection from the dead, which all who are in Christ will share when he comes (1 Cor 15:23). Although the Kingdom of God is not yet fulfilled in us, God gives us his Spirit in our hearts as a &#8220;first installment&#8221; (2 Col 1:22, 5:5). God&#8217;s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit which has been given to us (Rom 5:5). All Christians are individual members of the one body of Christ in the Church. In the on Spirit there are a variety of gifts, ministries and members (1 Cor 12:12-13, 27-28; Rom 12:4-12:6). In Christ there are no distinctions between Jew and Greek, slave and free, or male or female, because all are one in Christ (Gal 3:28). Paul&#8217;s influence is visible throughout the tradition of the Christian church, including Augustine, Aquinas, Martin Luther and John Calvin. The Episcopal theologian William Porcher DuBose was deeply influenced by Pauline theology , and he wrote <em>The Gospel According to Saint Paul </em>(1907).

        "Peace, The",
        "A liturgical exchange of greeting through word and gesture. It is a sign of reconciliation, love, and renewed relationships in the Christian community. It is initiated by the celebrant, who says, &#8220;The peace of the Lord be always with you.&#8221; The people respond, &#8220;And also with you.&#8221; The ministers and people may greet one another in the name of the Lord (BCP, pp. 332, 360). Any appropriate words of greeting may be used in the exchange of peace that follows between individuals (BCP, p. 407). The gesture of greeting has been expressed in a variety of ways, including a kiss on the cheek, an embrace, a handclasp, or a bow. The peace is also known as the kiss of peace and the Pax (from the Latin, &#8220;peace&#8221;).The peace is an ancient Christian practice. It has been associated with Rom 16:16, &#8220;Greet one another with a holy kiss,&#8221; and similar passages such as 1 Cor 16:20, 2 Cor 13:12, 1 Thes 5:26, and 1 Pt 5:14. The earliest references to the peace may be found in writings concerning the baptismal liturgies. After the baptism and the laying on of hands and anointing by the bishop, the newly baptized were included in the exchange of the peace for the first time. Justin Martyr indicates that during the second century the peace took place before the presentation of the gifts at the eucharist. It appears that the peace originally concluded the liturgy of the word. However, the peace was moved to the end of the eucharistic prayer in the Roman rite during the fifth century. The peace was exchanged at the time of the breaking of the bread prior to communion. The peace was exchanged at this time in the eucharistic liturgy of the 1549 BCP, and it continues in this position in the Roman rite. The peace was deleted in the 1552 BCP. The 1979 BCP restored the peace at the eucharist to its ancient position at the end of the liturgy of the word. The BCP still allows the peace to be exchanged at the time of the administration of communion, before or after the sentence of invitation (p. 407).At baptism, the peace follows the baptism and the welcome for the newly baptized by the celebrant and people (BCP, p. 308). At Confirmation, Reception, or Reaffirmation, it follows the bishop&#8217;s concluding prayer and precedes the prayers of the people or the offertory (BCP, pp. 310, 419). The peace concludes the service for the Celebration and Blessing of a Marriage, although communion may follow (BCP, p. 431). The new minister&#8217;s first action at the Celebration of a New Ministry is to initiate the peace (BCP, p. 563). The bishop initiates the peace at the end of the liturgy for the Consecration and Dedication of a Church, prior to the eucharist (BCP, p. 574). In the Order for Celebrating the Holy Eucharist, the peace may be exchanged after the prayers for the world and the church and before preparing the table, &#8220;or elsewhere in the service&#8221; (BCP, p. 401). Depending on the pastoral needs of the situation, it might be more appropriate to exchange the peace at the end or the beginning of this more informal eucharistic liturgy. The peace may be intoned by the celebrant and the people. The Hymnal 1982 provides musical settings for the peace (S 110-111).In the late middle ages, a wooden plaque or plate with a projecting handle was used to pass the peace without direct personal contact. It had an image of the crucifixion or another religious subject on the face. It was known as a Pax Board, Pax Brede, or Osculatorium. It was first kissed by the celebrant, and then passed to other ministers and members of the congregation who also kissed it. The custom of passing the peace by use of a Pax Board is now obsolete.",

In the sacramental rite of Reconciliation of a Penitent, those who repent of their sins may confess them to God in the presence of a priest and receive the assurance of pardon and the grace of absolution (p. 861). The BCP provides two forms for the Reconciliation of a Penitent (pp. 447-452). The season of Lent is a penitential season of preparation for the Easter celebration of Jesus&apos; resurrection. Ash Wednesday is the first day of Lent. At the Ash Wednesday service, the celebrant invites the people to the observance of a holy Lent &#8220;by self-examination and repentance; by prayer, fasting, and self-denial; and by reading and meditating on God&apos;s holy Word&#8221; (pp. 264-265). The Ash Wednesday service includes a Litany of Penitence (pp. 267-269). Many Prayer Book liturgies also include a confession of sin. The confession of sin and absolution follow the prayers of the people and precede the peace at the eucharist (BCP, pp. 331, 360). Another option is for the eucharist to begin with a Penitential Order (pp. 319-321, 351-353). The Penitential Order includes an acclamation and the confession of sin and absolution. It may also include the decalogue and one or more appropriate sentences of scripture. Compline includes a confession of sin and prayer for absolution (BCP, pp. 127-128).

For example, the penitent may be assigned a psalm, prayer, or hymn to say or an act of reparation to make. Sacramental reconciliation is available to all.

These sentences of scripture include the Summary of the Law, Mt 22:37-40 or Mark 12:29-31; 1 Jn 1:8-9; and Heb 4:14, 16. The Penitential Order may be used as an entrance rite during Lent or other times to emphasize the penitential aspect of the eucharist. The Penitential Order may be used as a separate service. When used separately, it concludes with suitable prayers and the grace or a blessing. When the Penitential Order is used to begin the eucharist, the service continues with the Gloria in excelsis, the Kyrie eleison, or the Trisagion. The confession and absolution are not repeated later in the service. A deacon or lay person who leads the Penitential Order uses a modified form for the absolution, praying &#8220;Almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us all our sins through our Lord Jesus Christ, strengthen us in all goodness, and by the power of the Holy Spirit keep us in eternal life&#8221; (BCP, p. 321, 353).

The Hebrew term Torah is also used to indicate the Pentateuch. It recounts the history of ancient Israel from Creation to the death of Moses in Moab just before the entrance of the Hebrew people into the promised land under Joshua. The traditional view has been that is was written by Moses at the command of God. After the Enlightenment, a Documentary Theory was developed by scholars that the Pentateuch consists of four different documents concerning Israel&#8217;s early life. According to this theory, the four documents were gradually combined over a period of several centuries to reach the Pentateuch&#8217;s present form around 400 B.C. The documents were termed the Yahwist epic, the Elohist epic, the Priestly Writing, and Deuteronomy. In more recent years this Documentary Theory has been challenged by various scholars, but no one view has proved itself sufficiently convincing to replace it.Perhaps no part of the OT is more important for both Jews and Christians than the Pentateuch, or Torah, as it is frequently called.

It was apparently an agricultural event that focused on the harvesting of first fruits. Josephus referred to Pentecost as the fiftieth day after the first day of Passover. The term is used in the NT to refer to the coming of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1), shortly after Jesus&apos; death, resurrection, and ascension. Christians came to understand the meaning of Pentecost in terms of the gift of the Spirit. The Pentecost event was the fulfillment of a promise which Jesus gave concerning the return of the Holy Spirit. The speaking in tongues, which was a major effect of having received the Spirit, is interpreted by some to symbolize the church&apos;s worldwide preaching. In the Christian tradition, Pentecost is now the seventh Sunday after Easter. It emphasizes that the church is understood as the body of Christ which is drawn together and given life by the Holy Spirit. Some understand Pentecost to be the origin and sending out of the church into the world. The Day of Pentecost is one of the seven principal feasts of the church year in the Episcopal Church (BCP, p. 15). The Day of Pentecost is identified by the BCP as one of the feasts that is &#8220;especially appropriate&#8221; for baptism (p. 312). The liturgical color for the feast is red. Pentecost has also been known as Whitsun or Whitsunday, a corruption of &#8220;White Sunday.&#8221; This term reflects the custom by which those who were baptized at the Vigil of Pentecost would wear their white baptismal garments to church on the Day of Pentecost. The BCP provides directions for observance of a Vigil of Pentecost, which begins with the Service of Light (p. 227).

In 1901 a Methodist evangelist, Charles Parham, began a Bible school in Topeka, Kansas. In 1906 a controversial African American Pentecostal preacher, William Seymour, began a series of revival meetings on Azusa Street in Los Angeles. Most modern Pentecostal denominations derive from these two sources. Since most of the converts were from conservative evangelical or holiness roots, the fundamentalist theology of these bodies became typical of Pentecostalism.

Perpetua and her companions were martyred in the arena at Carthage, c. 202. Their martyrdom is commemorated on Mar. 7 in the episcopal calendar of the church year. See Felicitas, or St. Felicity.",

        "Perry, James DeWolf",
        "(Oct. 3, 1871-Mar. 20, 1947). Eighteenth Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church. He was born in Germantown, Pennsylvania. Perry received his B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1891 and then received another B.A. from Harvard University in 1892. He received his B.D. from the Episcopal Theological School in 1895. Perry was ordained deacon on June 9, 1895. He began his ministry as an assistant at Christ Church, Springfield, Massachusetts. He was ordained priest on Feb. 18, 1896. From 1897 until 1904 he was rector of Christ Church, Fitchburg, Massachusetts. His last parochial ministry was as rector of St. Paul&apos;s Church, New Haven, Connecticut, 1904-1911. Perry was consecrated the seventh Bishop of Rhode Island on Jan. 6, 1911. He was elected Presiding Bishop by the House of Bishops on Mar. 26, 1930. Perry was reelected at the General Convention of 1931. He served until his retirement on Dec. 31, 1937. He was the last Presiding Bishop who retained his diocesan jurisdiction while serving in the national post. Perry was especially interested in foreign missions. In 1932 the Report of the Commission of Appraisal of the Laymen&apos;s Foreign Missions Enquiry was published with the title Rethinking Missions: A Layman&apos;s Enquiry after One Hundred Years. This independent commission was chaired by William Ernest Hocking. It was very critical of the missionary work of the Protestant churches. The National Council of the Episcopal Church asked Presiding Bishop Perry to make an independent study of the Episcopal Church&apos;s foreign missions. He and Mrs. Perry spent five months visiting mission stations in the Philippine Islands, China, Japan, and Hawaii. Upon his return to the United States, Perry announced his disagreement with the conclusions of Rethinking Missions. Perry died in Summerville, South Carolina.",

        "Peter, Saint",
        "(d. c. 64). Apostle and leader of the early church. He was first named Simon, but Jesus named him Cephas, or Peter, which means &#8220;rock.&#8221; He was also known as Simon Peter. Peter and his brother Andrew were fishermen on the Sea of Galilee. Jesus invited them to follow him and fish for people (Mt 4:18-20, Mk 1:16-18). In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus tells Peter to go into the deep water and let down his nets for a catch. Peter and his partners James and John then have a miraculous catch of fish. Jesus promises that from now on they will be catching people (Lk 5:4-11). The Gospel of John records that Andrew brought Peter to Jesus, and told him that Jesus was the Messiah. Jesus tells Simon that he will be called Cephas, which is translated Peter (Jn 1:40-42). Peter was married, and his wife accompanied him on his missionary journeys (1 Cor 9:5). Peter is named first and included in all lists of the twelve disciples (see Mk 3:16, Acts 1:13).The NT records many vivid events and discussions involving Peter and Jesus. Peter offered to walk to Jesus on the water, and he began to walk on the water. But Peter became frightened and began to sink. Jesus reached out his hand and caught him (Mt 14:28-33). Peter asked Jesus if he should forgive his brother as many as seven times. Jesus answered that he should forgive seventy-seven times (Mt 18:21-22). Peter asked Jesus what the disciples would have for following him. Jesus promised that when the Son of Man is seated on the throne of glory they would also sit on twelve thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel (Mt 19:27-28). Jesus asked his disciples &#8220;Who do you say that I am?&#8221; Peter answered that Jesus was the Messiah, the Son of the living God (Mt 16:15-16). In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus then names Peter and states that on this rock Jesus will build his church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it. The &#8220;rock&#8221; has been interpreted to mean either Peter or the faith in Christ that Peter expressed. Jesus also states that he will give Peter the keys of the kingdom, so that whatever he binds on earth is bound in heaven, and whatever he looses on earth is loosed in heaven (Mt 16:18-19). However, Peter&#8217;s confession of faith is followed by his rebuke of Jesus, who told the disciples about the great suffering that he would face in Jerusalem. Jesus sharply rebukes Peter, saying &#8220;Get behind me, Satan!&#8221; (Mt 16:21-23). Peter was always included in the &#8220;inner group&#8221; of disciples who were present with Jesus for times such as the healing of Jairus&#8217;s daughter (Mk 5:21-43), the Transfiguration of Jesus (Mt 17:1-8), and Jesus&#8217; agony in the Garden of Gethsemane (Mt 26:36-46). On the night of Jesus&#8217; betrayal, Peter boasts that he will never deny Jesus. But Jesus correctly predicts that Peter will deny him three times that night (Mt 26:33-35, 69-75). Jesus charges Peter to strengthen the other disciples after they have been scattered (Lk 22:31-32). Peter cuts off the ear of the high priest&#8217;s slave at the time of Jesus&#8217; arrest (Jn 18:10). Peter was the first disciple to witness Jesus&#8217; resurrection (Lk 24:34, 1 Cor 15:5).Peter was at the heart of the organization of the Christian church after Jesus&#8217; resurrection. The Gospel of John records a post-resurrection appearance in which Jesus charges Peter to feed his lambs and tend his sheep. Jesus also predicts Peter&#8217;s martyrdom (Jn 21:15-19). Peter urged the selection of a twelfth witness to the resurrection to take the place of Judas Iscariot (Acts 1:15-22). Peter preached to the multitude on Pentecost, and some 3,000 people were converted (Acts 2:14-41). Peter often served as spokesman for the church. He denounced the deceit of Ananias and Sapphira who were holding back money from the church (Acts 5:1-11), and he rejected an offer from a man named Simon who wanted to pay for the power to confer the Holy Spirit (Acts 8:18-24). Paul says that Peter was entrusted with the gospel for the circumcised (Gal 2:7). Peter also opened the church to Gentiles after seeing a vision of ritually unclean food descending from heaven and being told not to call profane what God had made clean. Peter ordered the baptism of the Gentile Cornelius along with his relatives and close friends (Acts 10:1-48). Peter was involved in miraculous healings. He healed a man who was crippled from birth (Acts 3:1-10), a man who had been bedridden for eight years (Acts 9:32-35), and a woman who had died (Acts 9:36-42). The sick were even placed on cots and mats in the streets so that Peter&#8217;s shadow might fall on some of them as he passed by (Acts 5:15). Peter ate with Gentiles at Antioch until certain people came from James. Peter then drew back and kept himself separate from the Gentiles. Paul opposed Peter to his face for this hypocrisy. Paul urged that we are justified by faith in Christ and not by doing the works of the law (Gal 2:11-21). The NT witness presents Peter to be a person with notable strengths and weaknesses. He was fallible and impetuous. He was also a strong leader of the disciples and the church, and a devoted witness to Christ. Although the NT is silent concerning his death, Peter was probably martyred in Rome during the persecution of the church by the Roman Emperor Nero. According to Origen, Peter was crucified head down at his own request. The Confession of Saint Peter the Apostle is celebrated on Jan. 18, and the feast of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, Apostles, is celebrated on June 29.",

In 1775 he went to England, where he was ordained deacon and priest. He was licensed by the Bishop of London as a missionary for the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel . He returned to North Carolina as the rector of St. Paul&apos;s Church, Edenton. Bishop William White of Pennsylvania suggested that Pettigrew call a meeting of the six Episcopal clergy in the state to organize the diocese. Two clergy and two laymen met at Tarboro on June 5, 1790, and elected deputies to the 1792 General Convention. At a convention held in Tarboro on May 31, 1794, Pettigrew was elected bishop. He was never consecrated for reasons of health. He was instrumental in founding the University of North Carolina in 1789. Pettigrew was one of the few Church of England clergy to participate in the Great Awakening and was an eighteenth-century evangelical and revivalist.

He resigned this position on Sept. 15, 1966, to become Theologian-in-Residence at the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions, Santa Barbara, California. Pike&apos;s controversial reputation was due to his passion and persistence in public issues such as birth control, women&apos;s rights, the racial crisis, McCarthyism, abortion, fair housing, the rights of homosexuals, censorship, civil liberties, and the Vietnam War. He was also critical of the church and its theology. His departure from orthodoxy began with an article in The Christian Century, Dec. 21, 1960, entitled &#8220;Three-pronged Synthesis.&#8221; He denied the historical virgin birth and claimed that Joseph was the human father of Jesus. He challenged the historical development of the doctrine of the Trinity, and called it &#8220;excess baggage.&#8221; He also experimented with the occult. In 1966 Bishop Henry Louttit of Florida presented five charges against Pike in the House of Bishops. One accusation was that Pike publicly taught doctrine contrary to that held by the Episcopal Church. The House of Bishops censured Pike and stated: &#8220;His writing and speaking on profound realities with which Christian faith and worship are concerned are too often marred by caricatures of treasured symbols and at the worst, by cheap vulgarizations of great expressions of the faith.&#8221; Pike was a prolific writer. His views are best stated in A Time for Christian Candor (1964), What Is This Treasure (1966), and If This Be Heresy (1967). He died in the Israeli desert some time between Sept. 3 and 7, 1969.",

Pittenger was a visiting professor at universities around the world. As a scholar he produced an extensive bibliography. Many of his books were popular in the sense that they were &#8220;designed to bring the truth of Christianity out of the cloister or the study and give it currency in the living thought of men and women today.&#8221; At the same time, his book, The Incarnate Word (1959), has been counted among the foremost studies in Christology in modern times. Pittenger was influenced by the theology of William Porcher DuBose, and he edited a collection of essays by DuBose which was published as Unity in the Faith (1957). He had a special interest in human sexuality and was supportive of gay and lesbian Christians. A festschrift, Lux in Lumine: Essays to Honor W.

        "Plainsong",
        "Sacred unison (monophonic) chant. Plainsong dates from the earliest centuries of Christianity. It has one melody (monodic). The plainsong melody is traditionally sung without musical accompaniment, although it is now at times accompanied by organ harmonies. Plainsong was most frequently based on the psalms. It is also used for canticles, antiphons, other sung liturgical texts, and hymns. For example, The Hymnal 1982 uses plainsong melodies with a variety of hymn texts, including &#8220;Creator of the stars of night&#8221; (Hymn 60), &#8220;Sing, my tongue, the glorious battle&#8221; (Hymn 166), and &#8220;Come, Holy Ghost, our souls inspire&#8221; (Hymn 504). The rhythm of plainsong is free and based on the words of the text rather than meter. Plainsong is not structured by musical bars or time. Since plainsong follows the rhythm of a text, its pulse falls irregularly.Plainsong may have been influenced by the musical tradition of the Jewish synagogue and the Greek modal system. A musical mode provides a scale or pattern of intervals for the arrangement of tones and semitones. At the end of the fourth century, Ambrose (c. 339-397), Bishop of Milan, ordered plainsong into four modes. Four more modes were added to the system of plainsong during the papacy of Gregory the Great (c. 540-604). This work was attributed to Gregory, and Gregorian Chant was named for him. There has been controversy concerning the extent of Gregory&#8217;s personal responsibility for this work. Other &#8220;dialects&#8221; of plainsong include Ambrosian, Mozarabic, Gallican, and Byzantine. The system of eight ecclesiastical or church modes for plainsong has continued to the present day. The plainsong repertory divides into chants for the Mass and chants for the Daily Offices.Gregorian Chant was taken to England by Augustine in 597. Augustine&#8217;s party were singing plainsong as they first approached King Ethelbert in the Isle of Thanet. The court of Ethelbert and the See of Augustine at Canterbury soon became a center for Gregorian plainsong. Charlemagne (c. 742-814) had a strong influence on the development of plainsong during the late eighth and early ninth centuries. He invited singers from Rome to his court at Aix-la-Chapelle, and he founded a school of song. The earliest manuscripts of plainsong and treatises on plainsong date from the ninth century. Around the year 1000 there began a period of decline for plainsong which continued into the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries. Renewed interest in liturgy and the monastic life in the Roman Catholic Church during the nineteenth century was accompanied by a revival of plainsong. The Benedictine Abbey of Solesmes in France was a center for study of plainsong and the editing of choral books. Much of this work took place under the leadership of Dom Joseph Pothier (1835-1923).After publication of the 1549 BCP, John Merbecke (or Marbeck) (c. 1510-c. 1585) set the English liturgy to plainsong in his The booke of Common praier noted (1550). He sought to create a distinctly English chant and used the new English liturgical texts as the starting point for his work. He simplified the older chant to fit the vernacular English text and also composed his own settings. However, Merbecke&#8217;s book was made obsolete by the 1552 BCP, and a revised edition of his work was not published. Plainsong came to disappear from the English Church until the Oxford Movement. However, plainsong did provide the basis for Anglican Chant, which dates from the seventeenth century. Anglican chant uses a harmonized melody without intonation for singing unmetrical texts such as psalms and canticles.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThere has been growing interest in plainsong since the Oxford Movement. Thomas Helmore published the first English plainsong Psalter that was widely used, The Psalter Noted (1849), followed by The Canticles Noted. These collections were published together as A Manual of Plainsong after 1850. H. B. Briggs and W. H. Frere revised A Manual of Plainsong in 1902. Charles Winfred Douglas published the Plainsong Psalter (1932), and Healey Willan published The Canadian Psalter-Plainsong Edition (1963). The Hymnal 1982 Accompaniment Edition, Vol. 1, includes the plainsong psalm tones (S 446). The Plainsong Psalter, edited by James Litton, was published by the Church Hymnal Corporation in 1988. Through these resources the ancient beauty of plainsong has been returned more fully to the life of the Episcopal Church. See Psalm Tone.",

This recognition acknowledges the full divinity of the Spirit, &#8220;who with the Father and the Son together is worshiped and glorified&#8221; (Nicene Creed, BCP, pp. 327, 328, 359). The decision represents the triumph of the Cappadocian Fathers over the pneumatomachians or Macedonians, who denied the full divinity of the Holy Spirit. 2) The definition of the difference between the Son and the Spirit. As the Council of Nicaea declared the Son to be &#8220;begotten, not made&#8221; (Nicene Creed, BCP, p. 326), the Council of Constantinople declared that the Spirit &#8220;proceeds from the Father&#8221; (see BCP, p. 327; Jn 15:26). 3) The addition to the Creed of the so-called &#8220;filioque&#8221; clause during the sixth century, perhaps at the Council of Toledo in 589 (or earlier). The clause asserts that the Spirit proceeds from &#8220;the Father and the Son.&#8221; This &#8220;addition&#8221; came to be universally accepted in the west but rejected by Eastern Orthodox churches. The 1988 Lambeth Conference recommended that the phrase be dropped from the Nicene Creed in Anglican churches.

In ecclesiastical use polity has come to refer also to the form of government for an organized church. In Anglicanism the term &#8220;polity&#8221; became common through its use by Richard Hooker who wrote Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity (1594). Hooker defended the episcopal government of the Church of England against the Puritans. He argued that the polity of the church and the state should express the rational nature of God as shown in the Natural Law. The church, as a political society, must be governed by law. But the form of polity which operates in the church may change at any given time. Thus Hooker was able to accept the polity of those protestant churches which did not have episcopal government.Episcopal polity describes a church in which the source of authority is the college of bishops, typically bishops within the historic episcopate. Presbyterian polity describes a church in which the source of authority is considered to be a synod of presbyters. In Anglican churches, bishops share power with presbyters and laity under a constitution. Eastern Orthodox churches exemplify episcopal polity in its purest form because their source of ecclesial power is a synod of bishops.",

        "Potter, Henry Codman",
        "(May 25, 1835-July 21, 1908). Bishop and advocate of social justice. He was born in Schenectady, New York, and was the son of Alonzo Potter, the third Bishop of Pennsylvania. In 1845 the family moved to Philadelphia, and he attended the Episcopal Academy in that city. He was a student at the Virginia Theological Seminary from 1854 to 1857. Potter was ordained deacon on May 27, 1857. His father placed him in charge of Christ Church, Greensburg, Pennsylvania. He was ordained priest on Oct. 15, 1858. In May 1859 he became the rector of St. John&apos;s Church, Troy, New York. He served there until Apr. 1866 when he was called to be assistant minister at Trinity Church, Boston. On Oct. 3, 1866, Potter was elected the seventeenth secretary of the House of Bishops. He was re-elected five times. He served until Oct. 23, 1883, when he had to step down after he became a bishop. After two years at Trinity Church, he was called to be the rector of Grace Church, New York. Potter was consecrated Assistant Bishop of New York on Oct. 20, 1883. He became the seventh Bishop of New York when his predecessor died on Jan. 2, 1887. He served in that position until his death. On Nov. 25, 1884, he heard the profession of James Otis Sargent Huntington as a monk. This was the beginning of the Order of the Holy Cross, the first monastic order for men in the Episcopal Church that was founded in the United States. Potter was one of the leaders of the Church Association for the Advancement of the Interests of Labor and a leading social gospel advocate in the Episcopal Church. He has been called &#8220;A Prophet of Social Reform.&#8221; He died in Cooperstown, New York.",

        "Potter, Horatio",
        "(Feb. 9, 1802-Jan. 2, 1887). Bishop and educator. He was born in Beekman (La Grange), Dutchess County, New York. He received his B.A. from Union College, Schenectady, New York, in 1826. He was ordained deacon on July 15, 1827, and priest on Dec. 14, 1828. His diaconate was spent at Trinity Church, Saco, Maine, and in 1828 he became professor of mathematics and natural philosophy at Washington College, Hartford, Connecticut. Potter became rector of St. Peter&apos;s Church, Albany, New York, in 1833, and on Nov. 22, 1854, he was consecrated the sixth Bishop of New York. Since Bishop Benjamin T. Onderdonk was still alive but suspended from office, Potter served as &#8220;provisional bishop&#8221; until Onderdonk&apos;s death on Apr. 30, 1861, when he became Bishop of New York. St. Stephen&apos;s College at Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, was established in 1860 under Potter&apos;s leadership. It was subsequently renamed Bard College. The Diocese of New York grew rapidly during Potter&apos;s episcopate. In 1868 the new dioceses of Albany, Central New York, and Long Island were created from the Diocese of New York. Potter died in New York City. Alonzo Potter was his brother. See Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, New York.",

        "Loving worship of God in prayer. We may respond with praise for God&apos;s mighty deeds throughout salvation history. The Canticle Te Deum laudamus (Canticle 21, BCP, pp. 95-96), begins, &#8220;You are God: we praise you.&#8221; It recalls that Christ &#8220;became man to set us free,&#8221; he &#8220;did not shun the Virgin&apos;s womb,&#8221; he &#8220;overcame the sting of death,&#8221; and he &#8220;opened the kingdom of heaven to all believers.&#8221; The people&apos;s response to the proclamation of the gospel is, &#8220;Praise to you, Lord Christ&#8221; (BCP, p. 358). The Prayer Book Catechism identifies praise as one of the seven principal kinds of prayer (p. 856). The Catechism notes that &#8220;We praise God, not to obtain anything, but because God&apos;s Being draws praise from us&#8221; (p. 857). Except during Advent and Lent, the Gloria in excelsis or another song of praise precedes the salutation and collect in the entrance rite of the eucharist (p. 356).

Both forms assume a relationship between God and the one who prays. Prayer is the opening of the direct relationship between God and humanity.

Thomas Comber published seven volumes entitled A Companion to the Temple and Closet (1672-76) in an attempt to reconcile dissenters. Two commentaries were published in 1710: William Nicholls&apos;s A Comment on the Book of Common Prayer and Charles Wheatly&apos;s A Rational Illustration of the Book of Common Prayer. Wheatly&apos;s book was reprinted as late as 1890. It was listed in the &#8220;Course of Ecclesiastical Studies, Established by the House of Bishops&#8221; in 1804 and reprinted in journals of General Convention through 1889. Also listed was John Reeves&apos;s Book of Common Prayer with Introduction and Commentary (1801). With the list was the Bishop of Lincoln&apos;s &#8220;Library of a Parish Ministry&#8221; which contained Wheatly&apos;s book and A Critical and Practical Elucidation of the Book of Common Prayer (1797) by Nicholls and John Shepherd. Commentaries on the 1789 American Prayer Book include Andrew Fowler&apos;s An Exposition of the Book of Common Prayer (1805) and T. C. Brownell&apos;s Family Prayer Book (1823). Substantial, often reprinted commentaries on the 1662 English Prayer Book include Francis Procter&apos;s A History of the Book of Common Prayer, with a Rationale of Its Offices (1855) (revised by W. H. Frere [1900]), John Henry Blunt&apos;s The Annotated Book of Common Prayer (1866), Evan Daniel&apos;s The Prayer-Book: Its History, Language, and Contents (1877), Alfred Barry&apos;s The Teacher&apos;s Prayer Book (1882) (an American edition based on the 1892 revision was published in 1898), Prayer-Book Commentary for Teachers and Students (1883), and Charles Neil and J.M. Willoughby&apos;s The Tutorial Prayer Book (1912). Massey H. Shepherd, Jr., produced The Oxford American Prayer Book Commentary (1950) as a companion to the 1928 revision.

The second and third paragraphs and a portion of the fourth are largely a paraphrase of the Preface to the English revision of 1662. The Preface to the American BCP is heavily dependent upon an anonymous volume arguing for Prayer Book revision, Free and Candid Disquisitions, which was published in London in 1749. The Preface states the principle that the worship of the church may be altered for the edification of the people and sets forth the aims of Prayer Book revision: preservation of peace and unity in the church, procuring of reverence, exciting of piety and devotion, and elimination of elements which provide occasion for &#8220;cavil or quarrel&#8221; against the Prayer Book liturgy.",

This was inaccurate since this Sunday fell sixty-four days before Easter. The second Sunday of the Pre-Lenten season was Sexagesima Sunday. It was the second Sunday before Lent and the eighth Sunday before Easter. Its name indicated sixty days before Easter, although it was fifty-seven days before Easter. Septuagesima Sunday and Sexagesima Sunday may have been reckoned from Quinquagesima Sunday, which was exactly fifty days before Easter. It was the last Sunday before Lent and the seventh Sunday before Easter. Similarly, the forty-day season of Lent and the first Sunday of Lent have been known as Quadragesima.Observance of the Pre-Lenten season dates from fifth- or sixth-century Roman practice.

In the Byzantine Rite, the liturgy of the pre-sanctified is used on weekdays during Lent (usually on Wednesdays and Fridays) when the eucharist is not celebrated. The liturgy of the pre-sanctified is celebrated in the west only on Good Friday. The use of the liturgy of the pre-sanctified on Good Friday dates from the early sacramentaries of the western church. The 1979 BCP allows Holy Communion to be administered from the reserved sacrament on Good Friday. The eucharistic elements that will be administered on Good Friday are consecrated at the Maundy Thursday service (p. 275). The administration of communion on Good Friday follows the solemn collects and devotions before the cross. A simple order of service is used, with a confession of sin and the Lord&apos;s Prayer preceding the communion (BCP, p. 282). A final prayer concludes the Good Friday service. The term &#8220;Mass (or liturgy) of the pre-sanctified&#8221; is not used in Anglican Prayer Books.",

The sermon draws together the life of the parish community, the life of the preacher, and the lives of those who hear the sermon. Preaching is to reflect God&apos;s presence, love, and guidance in a particular moment of the church&apos;s life. The sermon is not an abstract statement of truth, and it is not just a personalized commentary on scripture. The sermon must engage the faith and understanding of the one who preaches and the ones who hear. The Christian story, the congregation&apos;s story, and the preacher&apos;s story can be the one story of God&apos;s love that is proclaimed in the sermon. Preaching in the Episcopal Church is typically liturgical preaching. The BCP calls for the sermon to follow the gospel at the Holy Eucharist, Confirmation, Ordination, and the Celebration of a New Ministry. A sermon or address follows the gospel at the Consecration of a Church. The sermon follows the gospel or the peace at a baptism. A homily may follow the gospel at the Celebration and Blessing of a Marriage and at the Burial of the Dead.

Sunday takes precedence over all other feasts and observances of the church year. When a feast of our Lord or other major feast appointed cannot be observed because it occurs on a Sunday, the feast is normally transferred to the first convenient open day in the following week. Major feasts falling in Holy Week or Easter Week are transferred to the week following the Second Sunday of Easter, in the order of their occurrence. When a Feast of our Lord or another major feast occurs on a Sunday but does not take precedence, the collect, preface, and one or more of the lessons appointed for the feast may be substituted for those of the Sunday. However, this substitution may not be done from the Last Sunday after Pentecost through the First Sunday after the Epiphany, nor from the Last Sunday after the Epiphany through Trinity Sunday.

Eastern eucharistic liturgies typically have prefaces with a fixed text that recalls salvation history. This tradition is reflected in Eucharistic Prayer D, based on the liturgy of St. Basil, and Eucharistic Prayer C, both of which have a fixed preface (BCP, pp. 372-373, 369-371). Western eucharistic liturgies for certain major observances in the church year have typically included a variable portion of the preface which is included in the fixed or common portion of the preface. This variable preface reflects the theme or occasion of the day, and it is known as the proper preface. The Leonine Sacramentary, which is the oldest surviving Roman sacramentary, provided a separate preface for each Mass. The Gelasian Sacramentary had more than fifty proper prefaces, and the Sarum Missal had ten proper prefaces. The 1549 BCP provided five proper prefaces, including Christmas, Easter, Ascension, Pentecost, and Trinity Sunday.The 1552 BCP allowed the use of the Christmas, Easter, and Ascension prefaces through the octaves of those feasts, and permitted the Pentecost preface to be used until Trinity Sunday. The 1979 BCP includes twenty-two proper prefaces (pp. 377-382). There are three proper prefaces of the Lord&#8217;s Day, &#8220;Of God the Father,&#8221; &#8220;Of God the Son,&#8221; and &#8220;Of God the Holy Spirit.&#8221; There are nine proper prefaces for seasons, including Advent, Incarnation, Epiphany, two proper prefaces for Lent, Holy Week, Easter, Ascension, and Pentecost. There are ten proper prefaces for other occasions: Trinity Sunday, All Saints, Apostles and Ordinations, Dedication of a Church, Baptism, Marriage, Commemoration of the Dead, and three different options to commemorate a saint. Traditional language versions of the proper prefaces (BCP, pp. 344-349) are for use with both Rite 1 eucharistic prayers. Contemporary language versions of the proper prefaces are for use with Eucharistic Prayers A and B of Rite 2. The 1979 BCP provides a proper preface for all days of the church year, except weekdays after Pentecost that are neither saints&#8217; days nor an occasion for use of the propers for various occasions. Many of the proper prefaces are appointed for use in several different observances. For example, the proper preface for Trinity Sunday is used on Trinity Sunday, Independence Day, Saint Michael and All Angels, Thanksgiving Day, and the observances &#8220;Of the Holy Trinity,&#8221; &#8220;Of the Holy Angels,&#8221; and &#8220;For the Nation.&#8221; It may also be used for the observances &#8220;Of a Theologian and Teacher&#8221; and &#8220;For the Unity of the Church.&#8221; The Altar Book provides music in simple and solemn tone versions for all the proper prefaces.

A sufficient quantity of bread for the celebration may be placed on the paten, or the bread may be placed on the corporal in the vessel in which it was presented. It is customary to add a little water to the wine in preparing the table. There may also be a flagon on the altar from which additional chalices may be filled after the breaking of the consecrated bread. In order to express the symbolism of the one cup, it is appropriate that there be only one chalice on the altar during the Great Thanksgiving. Depending on the local custom of the congregation, the Altar Book may be placed on the altar at this time. The preparation of the table immediately precedes the eucharistic prayer and serves to draw the congregation&#8217;s attention from the pulpit to the altar in preparation for celebrating the Great Thanksgiving.The deacon&#8217;s function in preparing the table and placing the bread and wine upon it has been traced from the second century. At times the deacon brought a small table into the room or into the center of the congregation after the catechumens were dismissed and the prayers of the people were concluded. A white cloth was placed on the table. Offerings of bread and wine were brought to the table by the people, or the deacons moved among the people to receive the offerings. Bread and wine in sufficient quantity were put out for the sacrament, with the rest set aside for the clergy and the poor. In subsequent years the altar was prepared before the liturgy in some places. This change has been associated with the development of low Mass, in which the altar served as both pulpit and table. The 1979 BCP states that at the presentation of the offerings, representatives of the congregation will bring the people&#8217;s offerings of bread and wine, and money or other gifts, to the deacon or celebrant (pp. 333, 361). The BCP also directs that at the ordination of a deacon, the newly ordained deacon prepares the bread, pours sufficient wine (and a little water) into the chalice, and places the vessels on the table before the eucharist (p. 546). The BCP clearly identifies the deacon&#8217;s function in preparing the table and receiving the offerings at the eucharist.

        "Presbyter, Presbyterate",
        "From the Greek presbyteros, &#8220;elder&#8221; or &#8220;old man.&#8221; In the NT, &#8220;presbyter&#8221; indicates a leader of the church. The presbyterate refers to the collegial leadership of the presbyters of the church. A member of the Jewish Sanhedrin was said to belong to the presbyteron, which was the council of the elders of the people (see Lk 22:66). In Christian usage, the presbyters were at first indistinguishable from &#8220;overseers,&#8221; or bishops. The term &#8220;presbyter&#8221; was used interchangeably with episcopos, or bishop (see Ti 1: 5-7). By the second century, the presbyters joined with the bishop in an advisory council that was presided over by the bishop. The presbyters were associated with the bishop in the bishop&#8217;s ministry of pastoral oversight, administration, and liturgical leadership. However, the bishop was distinguished from the presbyters, who derived their authority from the bishop. By the third century the bishop came to delegate primary daily pastoral responsibility in a congregation or area to a presbyter. The presbyter would then be responsible for teaching and preaching, administration, and sacramental ministry in that place, under the oversight of the bishop. The English word &#8220;priest&#8221; is derived from &#8220;presbyter,&#8221; and used as a synonym for presbyter. After the Reformation, some churches began to use the term &#8220;presbyter&#8221; for the minister who preaches the word and administers the sacraments. The Anglican Church used the term &#8220;priest&#8221; for the second order of ministry. The 1979 BCP uses both terms. For example, directions for the Ordination of a Priest require that &#8220;at least two presbyters must be present&#8221; (p. 524). The Catechism notes that &#8220;the ministry of a priest or presbyter&#8221; is &#8220;to represent Christ and his Church, particularly as pastor to the people; to share with the bishop in the overseeing of the Church; to proclaim the gospel; to administer the sacraments; and to bless and declare pardon in the name of God&#8221; (BCP, p. 856). Some have favored use of &#8220;presbyter&#8221; because of historic association of the term &#8220;priest&#8221; with a narrow eucharistic piety, or with OT sacrifice. The term has also been favored in ecumenical discussions. The priests of a diocese or their meetings may be referred to as a &#8220;College of Presbyters.&#8221; <strong><a href=\"/library/glossary/priest\">See Priest</a></strong>.",

Harry Croswell, a leading Tractarian priest. Prescott attended Washington College, 1840-1842, and then studied for a year at Yale. He attended the General Theological Seminary and was ordained deacon on Sept. 16, 1847. Later in 1847, Prescott and William Glenny French made their monastic professions before Bishop Levi S. Ives of North Carolina at St. Luke&apos;s Church, New York. They were the first two members of Bishop Ives&apos;s Society of the Holy Cross. Prescott then immediately went to North Carolina. He worked in Rowan, Iredell, and Davis counties, but never went to Valle Crucis, the center of the society. In 1849 he went to Boston, Massachusetts, where he was assistant at the Church of the Advent. He heard confessions and pronounced private absolutions at the Church of the Advent. Bishop Manton Eastburn of Massachusetts brought him to trial for these practices. Prescott was acquitted and moved to Westminster, Maryland, where he served the Church of the Ascension. After several other moves, Prescott went to England in 1869. He joined the Society of St. John the Evangelist as the fourth member and second American professed in the society. In 1876 he returned to the United States and became the rector of St. Clement&apos;s Church, Philadelphia, a leading ritualist parish. The vestry of St. Clement&apos;s had invited the society to take charge of the parish. He served there until 1881. He left the society in 1882. Prescott spent the remaining years of his life as rector of St. Peter&apos;s Church, Ripon, Wisconsin, and rector of St. Luke&apos;s Church, New Haven. He died in Verbank, New York.",

There are many regional primates in the worldwide Anglican Communion today. They are variously known as primate, metropolitan, archbishop, or primus. In the Anglican Communion, the place of honor (but not of jurisdiction) is always given to the See of Canterbury.

From the later fourth century the Bishop of Rome began to claim and exercise primacy over all the other churches of the western world. By the later eleventh century the Bishop of Rome began to claim and exercise a universal primacy over the entire church.

Existence is understood in terms of the mutual interaction of entities, through which change occurs. Process theology is derived from the process philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead, whose Gifford Lectures were published as Process and Reality (1929). Not all process theologies are alike, but God tends to be understood in ways that differ from classic theism. God is understood as a participant in a larger creative process, so that God influences and is influenced by other entities. God is understood to participate in development through intercourse with a changing world, and may be seen to be subordinate to a larger creative process. God&apos;s power to create change in the world is persuasive rather than coercive, and exercised within the limits of the creative process. This limitation of God&apos;s power resolves questions about God&apos;s responsibility for evil in the world. But process theology tends to contradict the traditional Christian understanding of God&apos;s transcendence and perfection. Process thought has been developed by Charles Hartshorne, John B. Cobb, Jr., David R. Griffin, and Schubert Ogden. W. Norman Pittenger was the most prominent Anglican process theologian. See Pittenger, W. Norman.",

Services included entrance rites with a procession of clergy and readers in which the gospel book was carried inprocessionProcessions typically lead to the altar at the beginning of the service. A festal procession on a major feast may use the side aisles and main aisle of the church. This extended procession may pause for a station or special prayers to commemorate the occasion. Torches, banners, and incense may be carried in procession to add to the solemnity and excitement of the celebration. The entrance procession at the eucharist typically involves the ministers who will serve at the altar, including acolytes or servers, deacons or priests who will serve as assisting clergy, and the celebrant. The entrance procession may also include the choir. The gospel procession may lead to the midst of the congregation for the singing or reading of the gospel. Representatives of the congregation may bring the people&#8217;s offerings of bread and wine and money or other gifts to the deacon or celebrant at the offertory procession.Many liturgies of the Episcopal Church may include processions.

This double procession was expressed by the addition of the filioque clause to the Nicene Creed, which states that the Spirit &#8220;proceeds from the Father and the Son&#8221; (see BCP, p. 359). Eastern theology affirms that the Spirit proceeds from the Father through the Son. Eastern theology therefore denies the double procession of the Spirit and rejects the addition of the filioque clause to the Nicene Creed.

        "Prophet, Prophecy",
        "A prophet in the OT was called a messenger to proclaim the word of the God of the covenant to the people of the covenant. Prophecy refers to the message or work of a prophet.The prophetic movement in Israel developed over a period of time, from the eleventh century B.C. with ecstatic prophetic groups, through the tenth century with court prophets such as Nathan, into the ninth century with Elijah and Elisha, reaching its full flower in the eighth, beginning with Amos, and eventually flowing to the fifth with the incomparable author of Isaiah, chs. 40-55, known as &#8220;Deutero-Isaiah.&#8221; After that it gradually faded from Israel&#8217;s scene.Under a righteous and compassionate God, the prophets called for righteousness and compassion in society, stressing one or the other, depending on the historical situation. They spoke to their times but always with an eye to the future.The NT regards John the Baptist as the last of the OT prophets. Among his various offices, Jesus is also called a prophet (Lk 13:33). In the early church the office of prophet was recognized along with other offices such as apostle, teacher, and worker of miracles (1 Cor 12:28).",

The Psalter and metrical psalter were abridged to omit troublesome passages. Proper lessons were appointed for some days that lacked them, and proper NT lessons were appointed for Sundays. Some OT passages and most lessons from the Apocrypha were omitted. Black Letter Days were eliminated. &#8220;Minister&#8221; replaced &#8220;Priest.&#8221; &#8220;He descended into hell&#8221; was omitted from the Apostles&apos; Creed, and the Nicene and Athanasian Creeds deleted.

        "Protestantism",
        "Western Christianity that is not subject to papal authority. The term is from the protestatio at the Diet of Speyer of 1529 by Lutheran princes against the policies of Charles V that would have practically eliminated the Lutheran territorial churches. The term has positive connotations in the sense of witness and testimony to the truth. It is not just negative in the sense of protest against something. Historically, there have been a variety of Protestant expressions of faith and many Protestant churches or denominations. Protestant thought can be traced to John Huss (c. 1369-1415) of Bohemia. Huss questioned the authority of the Pope, as well as neglect of the Bible and the doctrine of grace. Huss was influenced by John Wycliffe (c. 1329-1384) of England, who upheld the superior authority of the Bible over the papacy.The Protestant schism came in the sixteenth century. Martin Luther (1483-1546) was a professor in the faculty of theology at the University of Wittenberg and vicar of the Augustinian order. On Oct. 31, 1517, Luther challenged the sale and abuse of indulgences by posting his Ninety-Five Theses on the door of the castle church at Wittenberg. Luther denied the primacy of the Pope and the infallibility of general councils in 1519 at the Leipzig Disputation. In 1520 Luther urged the civil rulers to reform the church. The Roman Catholic Church excommunicated Luther and condemned his teachings in 1521. After Luther&#8217;s condemnation by the Diet of Worms (1521), the Elector of Saxony protected Luther at Wartburg castle. Luther translated the NT into German while he was at Wartburg. The Diet of Speyer of 1526 granted princes the right to organize national churches. Lutheranism spread through many parts of Germany and Scandinavia. In the sixteenth century, &#8220;Protestant&#8221; meant Lutheran.Luther urged that Christians are justified only through God&#8217;s grace, which is received through faith. Christians are not justified or made righteous through their works or merits that result from their works. The Christian can therefore be described as &#8220;at once justified and a sinner&#8221; (simul justus et peccator). The righteousness of Christ is imputed to us by God and received by faith. We are thus justified by a righteousness that is extrinsic and alien to us personally. Although we are pronounced righteous by God in Christ, we continue to be sinners. Luther&#8217;s theology of the cross (Theologia Crucis) held that the saving and merciful God is known only as hidden in Christ crucified (see 1 Cor 1:17-31). Luther upheld the priesthood of all believers. He rejected purgatory, the veneration of saints, relics, monasticism, celibacy of the clergy, and Masses for the dead. Lutheranism has included several confessional statements that provide written summaries of doctrine. Luther&#8217;s Large and Small Catechisms appeared in 1529, and he prepared the Schmalkaldic Articles in 1536. Luther supported the Augsburg Confession (1530), which was drafted by Philipp Melanchthon (1497-1560). Melanchthon also prepared the Apology for the Augsburg Confession (1531). Lutheranism may be summarized in terms of belief in justification by faith alone (sola fides), justification by God&#8217;s grace alone (sola gratia), and the Bible as the only authoritative rule of faith (sola scriptura). Lutheran Churches in North America include the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, and the Lutheran Church-Wisconsin Synod.The Reformed Protestant tradition is associated with John Calvin (1509-1564). He was the leading figure in the sixteenth-century movement of reform in Switzerland. Calvin&#8217;s reform is especially associated with the city of Geneva, Switzerland. In July 1536, Guillaume Farel (1489-1565) convinced Calvin to stay in Geneva to organize the reform. Calvin and Farel were expelled from Geneva in 1538, but the city council invited Calvin to return in 1541. Calvin worked to establish a theocracy in Geneva, and Calvinism came to dominate the Protestant movement of reform. Another leader of reform in Switzerland was Ulrich Zwingli (1484-1531). He initiated the Swiss Reformation in Zurich in 1519. Zwingli was killed in battle in 1531 during the civil war between Zurich and Roman Catholic cantons. Zwingli was succeeded in Zurich by Heinrich Bullinger (1504-1575). In May 1549, differences between the reformed churches in Zurich and Geneva were resolved by the Zurich Consensus (Consensus Tigurinus), which was agreed to by Calvin, Farel, and Bullinger. The Reformed Church movement in Switzerland was consolidated by their agreement.Calvin published the first edition of his Institutes of the Christian Religion in 1536. The last edition of the Institutes was published in 1559. His teaching emphasized the sovereignty of God, scripture as the supreme rule of faith and life, the total depravity of humanity after the Fall, the predestination of the elect to salvation and the reprobate to damnation, and the importance of the church as an ordered and disciplined community. The ministers or officers of the Reformed Church included pastors, teachers, elders, and deacons. The Dutch Reformed theologian Jacob Arminius (1560-1609) sought to moderate Calvinist teaching concerning predestination and the importance of free human will relative to divine sovereignty. The Synod of Dort (1618-1619) of the Dutch Reformed Church responded to Arminianism by upholding strict Calvinist principles concerning total depravity, unconditional election, limited atonement, irresistibility of grace, and the perseverance of the saints. The Reformed Church in Switzerland influenced the French Huguenots, the Scottish Church reforms of John Knox (c. 1513-1572), the Puritans in England, and the reformed churches in the Netherlands. Calvin&#8217;s influence is seen in the American Reformed, Congregational, and Presbyterian churches.The Anabaptists were radical Protestants who held that only believing adults should be baptized. They called for the rebaptism of those who were baptized as infants. Anabaptists also stressed the importance of inner religious experience and held that believers should not be involved with or subject to the civil authority. Military service was rejected. Anabaptist groups tended to support nonresistance and pacifism. There were Anabaptist groups in Germany, Switzerland, Moravia, and the Low Countries. Noted Anabaptist leaders included the Zwickau Prophets Nicholas Storch (d. c. 1530) and Thomas Müntzer (c. 1489-1525), Jacob Hutter (d. 1536), Melchior Hoffmann (c. 1500-c. 1543), and Menno Simons (c. 1496-1561). Anabaptists were persecuted by both Roman Catholics and other Protestants. The Anabaptist tradition continues in the Mennonites, the Hutterites, the Amish, the Quakers, and some Baptists.Anglicans are categorized as Protestants by many Roman Catholics, Protestants, and some Anglicans. Article XIX of the Articles of Religion clearly states that &#8220;the Church of Rome hath erred, not only in their living and manner of Ceremonies, but also in matters of Faith&#8221; (BCP, p. 871). However, some Anglicans are ambivalent about being categorized as Protestants because of the importance of the catholic tradition in Anglicanism. In this regard, catholicity is understood in terms of what has been believed everywhere, always, and by all in the church rather than submission to papal authority and Roman Catholic doctrine. The Anglican, Orthodox, and Roman Catholic churches are understood by some Anglicans to be branches of the one holy catholic and apostolic church. When a confirmed member of the Roman Catholic or Orthodox churches is received into the Episcopal Church, the bishop says, &#8220;we recognize you as a member of the one holy catholic and apostolic Church, and we receive you into the fellowship of this Communion&#8221; (BCP, p. 418). Anglicanism reflects both catholic and Protestant influences in liturgy, polity, and doctrine.John Wesley (1703-1791) was the founder of Methodism within the Church of England during the eighteenth century. Methodism was a movement of pietistic revivalism. Wesley was a student at Oxford when he organized a &#8220;Holy Club&#8221; that included his brother Charles Wesley (1707-1788), George Whitefield (1714-1770), and several other students. They were &#8220;methodical&#8221; in their devotion to disciplines such as Bible study and visiting the needy. They came to be known as Methodists. John Wesley had a conversion experience at a Moravian meeting in Aldersgate Street, London, in 1738. He recalled that his heart was &#8220;strangely warmed.&#8221; Charles also had an experience of inner conversion in 1738. The Methodist revival emphasized personalized faith and conversion of the heart. Methodist theology has been characterized as Arminian. John and Charles both engaged in an itinerant ministry of preaching. Charles wrote over 5,000 hymn texts, including &#8220;Come, thou long expected Jesus&#8221; (Hymn 66), &#8220;O for a thousand tongues to sing my dear Redeemer&#8217;s Praise&#8221; (Hymn 493), and &#8220;Love divine, all loves excelling&#8221; (Hymn 657). Hymn singing has an important role in Methodist worship. John organized and extended the Methodist Movement. Lay preachers were used to proclaim the gospel. Conferences of lay preachers were held in England from 1744. In 1784 John ordained Thomas Coke (1747-1814) as Superintendent for the Methodists in America. John also instructed Coke to ordain Francis Asbury (1745-1816) as a Superintendent. Coke and Asbury became joint superintendents of Methodist work in America. The title superintendent was changed to bishop in 1787. Preachers were elected and ordained at the Christmas Conference in 1784 in Baltimore, Maryland. The Methodist Episcopal Church in America was begun. Charles opposed the ordinations by John, who was a priest of the Church of England. Charles also opposed separation from the Church of England. Although John performed more than twenty ordinations of English Methodists before he died, the schism of the Methodists from the Church of England followed his death. John and Charles Wesley are commemorated in the Episcopal calendar of the church year on Mar. 3. The United Methodist Church is one of the largest Protestant denominations in the United States and the largest Methodist body in the world. There are also smaller Methodist churches in the United States, such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church.The twentieth-century Pentecostal movement in the United States is associated with the ministry of Charles Parham (1873-1937) in the early 1900s. Parham connected baptism in the Spirit with glossolalia. In 1901 Parham led the Apostolic Faith movement in Kansas, Missouri, and Texas. Parham&#8217;s ministry was continued in 1906 in Zion City, Illinois. A significant expansion of the Pentecostal movement came with the Azusa Street revival in Los Angeles, 1906-1909, under the African American pastor William J. Seymour. Pentecostalism upholds a continuing Pentecost in which baptism in the Spirit is accompanied by speaking in tongues and divine healing. Pentecostals are usually fundamentalists. Pentecostals have not generally been engaged in the ecumenical movement. The Charismatic Movement is considered by some to be a continuation or second wave of Pentecostalism. Participants in the Charismatic Movement believe in the availability of personal pentecostal experience in the Spirit, which may often be accompanied by speaking in tongues and spiritual gifts (charisms or charismata; see 1 Cor 12:8-10). Some Episcopal congregations reflect the influence of the Charismatic Movement.Although there are many Protestant traditions and denominations, there are also many shared concerns and beliefs within Protestantism. Protestant churches generally emphasize the proclamation of the Word of God. Preaching and study of the Bible have an important role in Protestantism. The individual life of faith by grace is central, including personal morality with the Bible as the ultimate standard of belief and conduct. Many Protestant denominations showed interest in the ecumenical movement during the twentieth century, and some churches merged. There has been Protestant support for conciliar movements such as the World Council of Churches. Protestants were also active in social issues during the nineteenth and twentieth century, such as emancipation, suffrage, temperance, desegregation, and opposition to warfare and domestic violence.",

        "Purification of Women (after childbirth)",
        "The title given in the 1549 BCP to the rite commonly called the Churching of Women. It is derived from the Sarum rite. Its ultimate source is the Jewish rite of purification, and the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary (Lk 2:22-39). St. Augustine of Canterbury mentions the existence of this Christian rite. In the 1552 BCP the title of the service was changed to &#8220;The Thanksgiving of Women after Childbirth, commonly called the Churching of Women.&#8221; In the 1979 BCP the service was replaced by &#8220;A Thanksgiving for the Birth or Adoption of a Child.&#8221; The text of the Prayer Book service has always stressed thanksgiving for the mother&apos;s preservation through &#8220;the great danger of childbirth.&#8221; The service itself includes a psalm and prayers. The churching was originally the occasion for the return of the child&apos;s white baptismal robe to the parish. The present rite includes both parents and gives thanks for the birth (or adoption) of the child. All suggestions of ritual impurity have been removed.",

        "Puritanism",
        "The term has become an epithet without precise meaning. At one time it described a reform movement in the Church of England during the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It sought to carry the English Reformation beyond the stage reached in the reign of Elizabeth I. In this sense the term was first applied to those who wished to &#8220;purify&#8221; the church from the remnants of &#8220;popery.&#8221; Puritanism included representatives of a wide range of doctrines, from Presbyterians, independents, and separatists, through levellers and millenarians. Within English Puritan ranks there was much lively debate. Puritan literature of the seventeenth century was thus by definition polemic.By the 1640&#8217;s, in an overheated atmosphere complicated by new ideas of political, economic and institutional reform, radical Puritanism could no longer be fitted into the constitutional structure of the English state.Radical Puritans turned against the conservative element in Protestantism-against Presbyterianism, against the rule of elders, and finally against every form of authority in society, the state, or the law. The Puritan recognized only human experience-the authority derived from direct religious revelation, the &#8220;trying of the spirit.&#8221; In the Puritan view, the only true Christian person is the person who knows God. All that mattered was salvation and God&#8217;s light, wherever they might appear. Any person could find salvation. By the late 1640s radical Puritanism had spawned political radicalism in England and America.Puritanism was an important force in England. It contributed to the idea of political liberty and democracy and to the development of the &#8220;nonconformist conscience.&#8221; However, in matters of religious life it spent its energies in sharpening distinctions with respect to questions of concern chiefly to students of political theory. In America, Puritans did not spend their energies debating with each other. They marked off the boundaries of new towns, enforced criminal laws, and fought Indians undistracted by theology or metaphysics. Allowing no dissent, they moved single-mindedly to the task of overcoming the unpredictable perils of the wilderness. If English Puritans were the precursors of modern democracy, those in America helped to found a nation.",

In 1824 he became a fellow at Oriel College, Oxford, where he became closely associated with John Henry Newman and John Keble. Pusey was ordained deacon on June 1, 1828, and priest on Nov. 23, 1828. Late in 1828 he was named Regius Professor of Hebrew at Oxford and Canon of Christ Church, positions he held until his death. In 1833 the Tracts for the Times began to appear and the Tractarian movement commenced. Pusey wrote Tract 18, Thoughts on the Benefits of the System of Fasting enjoined by our Church, and thus became a part of the movement. His most famous tract was Scriptural Views of Holy Baptism, which was actually three tracts (Nos. 67, 68, and 69), published in 1835. Pusey became the leader of the Tractarian or Oxford movement when Newman joined the Roman Catholic Church in 1845. Pusey established the first Anglican sisterhood since the Reformation, the Sisterhood of the Holy Cross, in 1845. He died at the convent at Ascot Priory in Berkshire. His ministry is commemorated in the Episcopal calendar of the church year on Sept. 18.",

He was a supporter of the Oxford Movement and was deeply interested in the educational mission of the church. Quintard was the second founder of the University of the South after the devastation of the Civil War. In Mar. 1866 he went to Sewanee, selected locations for the buildings, and planted a cross. He was the first vice-chancellor of the University, Feb. 14, 1867-July 12, 1872, and presided at its official opening on Sept. 18, 1868. He made several trips to England to raise money for the University. On one of those trips he convinced a woman to give the money for a theological building.

        "The belief that the eucharistic elements of bread and wine are unchanged during the prayer of consecration but that the faithful believer receives the body and blood of Christ in receiving communion. This was the prevailing eucharistic theology in the Reformation era of Anglicanism. The Articles of Religion state that the bread and wine of the eucharist are the body and blood of Christ &#8220;to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith, receive the same. . . .&#8221; Article XXVIII, Of the Lord&apos;s Supper (BCP, p. 873). Thomas Cranmer held a receptionist understanding of the eucharist, which informed his work on the 1549 and 1552 Prayer Books. This historic receptionistic language is still retained in Eucharistic Prayer I of Rite 1. However, Anglican eucharistic theology has tended to hold in balance both an objective change of some kind in the eucharistic elements to become the body and blood of Christ and the subjective faith of the believer who receives the sacrament. The words of administration of the 1559 Prayer Book joined language from the 1549 BCP that identified the sacrament as the body and blood of Christ with more receptionistic language from the 1552 BCP that urged the communicant to receive the sacrament &#8220;in remembrance&#8221; of Christ&apos;s sacrifice. This combination was continued in the 1662 BCP, and in subsequent American Prayer Books (see BCP, p. 338). The balance of objective and subjective theologies of the eucharist is also presented by the Catechism, which states that &#8220;The inward and spiritual grace in the Holy Communion is the Body and Blood of Christ given to his people, and received by faith&#8221; (BCP, p. 859). The receptionistic language of Eucharistic Prayer I in Rite 1 is not found in the other eucharistic prayers of the BCP. See Real Presence; see Transubstantiation.",

Direct recitation means the reading or singing of the entire psalm or portion of the psalm in unison. It is frequently used to recite or chant the psalm following the first lesson at the eucharist and the canticles at the Daily Offices. Antiphonal recitation is the alternation of verses of the psalm between two groups of singers or readers, e.g., the sides of the congregation, men and women, choir and congregation. An antiphon said or sung in unison may begin and conclude antiphonal recitation. It is the traditional monastic method of reciting the psalms at the Daily Offices. Responsorial recitation assigns the verses to a single voice, with the congregation responding with a refrain after each verse or group of verses. This is the traditional method of singing the invitatory psalm at Morning Prayer and the psalm between the readings, often called the responsorial psalm.",

        "Recognition and Investiture of a Diocesan Bishop",
        "This is one of the &#8220;Episcopal Services&#8221; in the BOS. It is designed for the recognition, investiture, and seating of a bishop who has already been ordained and consecrated. The Presiding Bishop presides at this service, but another bishop may be deputized for the occasion. The service takes place in the context of a eucharist. The rubrics envisage that this service will take place in the cathedral church. However, it may be held in another suitable place, and the service may be adapted when necessary. At the Recognition, the Presiding Bishop is escorted to a chair placed at the entrance to the chancel, facing the people. The new bishop is escorted by the welcoming procession to a place before the Presiding Bishop. Ps 23 appropriately follows with the antiphon &#8220;I will give you a shepherd after my own heart, who will feed you with knowledge and understanding.&#8221; The new bishop petitions for recognition and investiture. A representative of the diocese states that the new bishop was duly elected and that consents to the election have been received. The people recognize and receive the new bishop and promise to uphold the new bishop in this ministry. After the Litany for Ordinations or another litany, the Presiding Bishop says the collect of the day or the collect for ordination. The liturgy of the word continues in the usual manner. After the sermon and the creed, the new bishop may reaffirm the commitments of episcopal ordination. At the Investiture, the Presiding Bishop invests the new bishop with all temporal and spiritual rights and responsibilities of the bishop&apos;s new office. If the pastoral staff is given to the new bishop, it is presented by the former bishop of the diocese, or it is brought from the altar and presented by the representative of the diocese. The new bishop lays a hand upon a Bible that is brought from the altar, and takes the oath of office. If the bishop is to be seated in the cathedra, the seating follows the taking of the oath. The new bishop is escorted by the Presiding Bishop and the representative of the diocese to the chair designated for the diocesan bishop. The new bishop may be seated in the cathedra by the dean of the cathedral. After the bishop sits, the people may offer their acclamations and applause. Bells may be rung and trumpets sounded. The new bishop is the chief celebrant at the eucharist. Other bishops and representative presbyters of the diocese may concelebrate the eucharist with the new bishop. The postcommunion prayer for this service is the prayer used after communion at ordinations. At the end of the service, the new bishop blesses the people, and the people are dismissed by a deacon.",

        "Reconciliation of a Penitent",
        "Sacramental rite in which those who repent may confess their sins to God in the presence of a priest and receive the assurance of pardon and the grace of absolution (BCP, p. 861). It is also called penance and confession. The church&#8217;s ministry of reconciliation is from God, &#8220;who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and has given us the ministry of reconciliation&#8221; (2 Cor 5:18). The ministry of reconciliation has been committed by Christ to the church. It is exercised through the care each Christian has for others, through the common prayer of Christians assembled for public worship, and through the priesthood of the church and its ministers declaring absolution (BCP, p. 446). The Reconciliation of a Penitent is not limited to times of sickness. Confessions may be heard at any time and any place.The BCP provides two forms of service for the Reconciliation of a Penitent. Only a bishop or priest may pronounce absolution. A declaration of forgiveness may be used by a deacon or lay person who hears a confession. When a confession is heard in a church building, the confessor may sit inside the altar rails while the penitent kneels nearby. The confession may be heard in a place set aside for greater privacy. It is also appropriate for the confessor and penitent to sit face to face for a spiritual conference that leads to absolution or a declaration of forgiveness. After the penitent has confessed all serious sins troubling the conscience and given evidence of contrition, the priest offers counsel and encouragement before pronouncing absolution. Before pronouncing absolution, the priest may assign a psalm, prayer, or hymn to be said, or something to be done, as a sign or penitence and act of thanksgiving.The 1979 BCP is the first American Prayer Book to provide forms for the Reconciliation of a Penitent as a separate office. Form One (p. 447) is shorter and less elaborate than Form Two (p. 449), which includes material similar to the Byzantine form for confession. Form Two begins with verses from Psalm 51 and the Trisagion, and it includes scriptural words of comfort. A rubric in Form Two also directs that the priest lay a hand upon the penitent&#8217;s head or extend a hand over the penitent at the absolution. This gesture also may be used at the absolution in Form One. The secrecy of the confession is morally absolute for the confessor and must not be broken (BCP, p. 446).",

        "Redeemer",
        "Savior. One who pays a price to buy back something, to liberate a person or a people from bondage, or to save a life that was legally forfeit. In the OT, the Lord God is the redeemer of Israel (see Ex 6:6; 2 Sm 7:23; Ps 130:7; Is 44:6, 54:5). God delivered Israel from bondage in Egypt and from the Babylonian exile. The OT also includes a messianic expectation of the redeemer who will come (see Is 7:14-17, 9:1-7, 11, 40:1-11). Christians identify Jesus Christ as the expected messiah and redeemer. Jesus is the redeemer of fallen humanity (see Rom 3:24; Gal 3:13, 4:4-5; Ti 2:14). The NT uses a variety of images and metaphors to present Jesus as our redeemer. The sacrifice of Jesus&#8217; life is described as &#8220;a ransom for many&#8221; (Mk 10:45; Mt 20:28). Jesus predicted that he would draw all to himself when he was lifted up from the earth (Jn 12:32). Jesus was &#8220;handed over to death for our trespasses and was raised for our justification&#8221; (Rom 4:25). He is the &#8220;Second Adam,&#8221; who restores humanity to righteousness and right relationship with God (see Rom 5:19). St. Paul states that &#8220;as all die in Adam, so all will be made alive in Christ&#8221; (1 Cor 15:22). The Letter to the Hebrews (2:17) states that Jesus was &#8220;a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God&#8221; who made &#8220;a sacrifice of atonement for the sins of the people.&#8221;Jesus&#8217; role as our redeemer is at the heart of Christian theology. This theme is powerfully expressed in the worship of the Episcopal Church. The collect for the Second Sunday of Advent prays that &#8220;we may greet with joy the coming of Jesus Christ our Redeemer (BCP, pp. 159, 211). The first collect for Easter Day states that God gave his only-begotten Son to death on the cross for our redemption and that Jesus delivered us from the power of our enemy by his glorious resurrection (BCP, pp. 170, 222, 295). Eucharistic Prayer B recalls that in these last days God the Father sent Jesus &#8220;to be incarnate from the Virgin Mary, to be the Savior and Redeemer of the world&#8221; (BCP, p. 368). The Hymnal 1982 includes &#8220;Redeemer of the nations, come&#8221; as a hymn for Advent (Hymn 55).Redemption may be understood in terms of atonement, forgiveness of sins, justification, deliverance from the power of death, righteousness, and the doing away with human alienation from God. Christians affirm that we may share the saving benefits of Christ&#8217;s life, death, and resurrection through baptism and participation in the life of the church (see Col 2:12; Rom 6:4-5).",

Relics may be placed in a reliquary for protection and display. The veneration of relics has been an ancient and at times controversial practice in Christianity. Some have believed that religious relics have miraculous powers. Supporters of the veneration of relics have noted the powers associated with Elijah&apos;s mantle (2 Kgs 2:14), the bones of Elisha (2 Kgs 13:21), and the handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched Paul&apos;s skin (Acts 19:12). The bodies of early Christian martyrs were venerated by the church, including the remains of Ignatius and Polycarp, who were martyred in the second century. The eucharist was celebrated over the tombs of Christian martyrs in the catacombs of Rome in the fourth century. The Second Council of Nicaea (787) and the Council of Constantinople (1084) were supportive of the veneration of religious relics. However, icons came to exercise a more important role than relics in the spirituality of the eastern church. The veneration of religious relics increased during the middle ages, especially as the crusaders brought back to Europe a variety of objects from the Holy Land. Relics were often placed as close as possible to the altar in a church or chapel. Abuses were associated with religious relics, including bogus claims, superstitious practices, competing shrines, and the marketing of religious relics. Protestant reformers such as John Huss (c. 1372-1415) and Martin Luther (1483-1546) opposed the cult of relics.

        "When there are no candidates for baptism or Confirmation at the Easter Vigil, the celebrant leads the people in the Renewal of Baptismal Vows (BCP, pp. 292-294). The Renewal of Baptismal Vows traditionally follows the Easter Vigil readings. It may also follow the gospel and a sermon or homily. The celebrant invites the people to the Renewal of Baptismal Vows with a bidding that recalls the Easter theme of death and rebirth with Christ by baptism. This address notes that the Lenten observance is ended and invites the people to renew the solemn promises and vows of baptism (BCP, p. 292). The Renewal of Baptismal Vows includes nine questions by the celebrant with responses by the people. The people&apos;s response to the first question reaffirms their renunciation of evil and renews their commitment to Jesus Christ. This recalls the threefold renunciation of Satan, evil, and sin and the threefold commitment to Christ of the baptismal service (BCP, pp. 302-303). The remaining eight questions and responses are the same as the baptismal covenant (see BCP, pp. 304-305). The affirmations of the Apostles&apos; Creed (the Baptismal Creed) are made by the people in response to the second, third, and fourth questions by the celebrant. These questions and responses correspond to the three sections of the Apostles&apos; Creed (see BCP, p. 96). The baptismal covenant then continues with five additional questions and responses concerning how the people will live the Christian life. This form for the Renewal of Baptismal Vows may also be used at the other baptismal feasts (Pentecost, All Saints&apos; Day or the Sunday after All Saints&apos; Day, and the Feast of the Baptism of our Lord) when there is no candidate for baptism.

In 1979 a revised version of the reproaches which avoided the possible misinterpretation appeared in the Methodist From Ashes to Fire, and was subsequently included in The Book of Alternative Services of the Anglican Church of Canada (1985).

For example, Suffrages A and B in Morning Prayer each contain a series of versicles and responses (BCP, pp. 97-98). The initial letter &#8220;R&#8221; indicates the responses in these suffrages and in other pairs of versicles and responses (see, e.g., BCP, p. 569). Noonday Office and Evening Prayer begin with the versicle, &#8220;O God, make speed to save us,&#8221; and the response, &#8220;O Lord, make haste to help us&#8221; (BCP, pp. 103, 117). This versicle and response, which is based on Ps 70:1, also follows the confession of sin at the beginning of Compline (BCP, p. 128).The readings from scripture at Noonday Office and Compline are followed by the people&#8217;s response, &#8220;Thanks be to God.&#8221; After each lesson at Morning Prayer, Evening Prayer, and the eucharist, the reader may say, &#8220;The Word of the Lord,&#8221; and the people answer, &#8220;Thanks be to God.&#8221; The reader may also say, &#8220;Here ends the Lesson (or reading),&#8221; to which no verbal response is made by the people. After the deacon or priest announces the gospel at the eucharist, the people answer, &#8220;Glory to you, Lord Christ.&#8221; After the gospel is read or sung, the reader says, &#8220;The Gospel of the Lord,&#8221; and the people answer, &#8220;Praise to you, Lord Christ.&#8221; The customary responses before and after the gospel are omitted on Palm Sunday and Good Friday (BCP, pp. 272, 277).Intercessions and other prayers may also have a response. For example, the biddings of the prayers of the people, Form V, are followed by the people&#8217;s response, &#8220;Lord, have mercy&#8221; (BCP, p. 389). At the Ordination of a Bishop, the people respond to questions by the Presiding Bishop, answering that it is their will that the bishop-elect be ordained a bishop and that they will uphold the bishop-elect as bishop (BCP, p. 514).In addition to fixed liturgical responses, there are also occasions when a response may be a personal statement. A response to the scripture readings may follow the gospel at a Marriage (BCP, p. 426). Responses may be made to the sermon at a Celebration of New Ministry (BCP, p. 560). At the Dedication and Consecration of a Church, the bishop may respond to the plans of the congregation for witness to the gospel by indicating the place of the congregation within the life of the diocese (BCP, p. 576).",

The resurrection of Jesus is at the heart of Christianity (Acts 2:22-36). Christian faith would be meaningless without the resurrection of Jesus (1 Cor 15:14). The reality of Jesus&apos; resurrection was experienced by chosen witnesses and proclaimed by the early Christian community. Easter is the day of Jesus&apos; resurrection. Jesus is understood to have been raised on the Sunday following the Friday of his crucifixion. The resurrection is to be distinguished both from resuscitation (restoration to the prior mode of human existence) and the immortality of the soul. Jesus&apos; resurrection began the transformation and glorification of the whole cosmos, including the redeemed Christian community. Christ was raised as the &#8220;first fruits of those who have fallen asleep&#8221; (1 Cor 15:20). By Christ&apos;s resurrection, this same new mode of existence is made available to all. The Catechism notes that &#8220;By his resurrection, Jesus overcame death and opened for us the way of eternal life&#8221; (BCP, p. 850).

Retreats often focus on particular themes of the church year. Retreats may be communal, though they can also be individual and undirected or unstructured. The concept of retreat has its roots in the scriptural injunction to withdraw to a quiet, lonely place as Christ did periodically. The practice of making retreats is also based in the monastic tradition of structured time for silence and contemplation to balance the spiritual life between the contemplative way of life and the active way of life. The retreat movement reached a twentieth-century high point after World War II in the 1940s and 1950s.

For example, the disobedience of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden (Gn 3) was unrighteous because it distorted relationship with God. In the OT, righteousness was understood in terms of the demands of God&#8217;s covenant with Israel. Righteous behavior upheld the covenant relationship. The NT acknowledges human incapacity to fulfill the demands of righteousness. Paul states that &#8220;all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God&#8221; (Rom 3:23). We share by nature in the tendency to turn away from God and the demands of righteousness (see Art. IX, Articles of Religion, BCP, p. 869). But human righteousness is made possible through faith in Christ and participation in Christ&#8217;s life by the Holy Spirit (see Rom 1:17, 5:5, 9:30). Paul states that &#8220;as all die in Adam, so all will be made alive in Christ&#8221; (1 Cor 15:22). The &#8220;many will be made righteous&#8221; by Christ&#8217;s obedience (Rom 5:19), which enables us to &#8220;walk in newness of life&#8221; (Rom 6:4). In Christ, we may live in righteousness with God and each other. Christ is the &#8220;Sun of Righteousness,&#8221; as noted by Charles Wesley in &#8220;Christ, whose glory fills the skies&#8221; (Hymns 6-7 in The Hymnal 1982).Righteousness is understood in terms of right relationship with God and others and not primarily in ethical or legal terms. But our right relationship with God and others is expressed through a moral and generous life. The righteous will feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, welcome the stranger, clothe the naked, care for the sick, and visit those in prison (see Mt 25:31-46). Protestant theology has tended to emphasize that God pronounces us righteous even while we remain sinners. According to this view, our righteousness is understood to be alien and extrinsic. Our justification takes place through God&#8217;s righteousness, not our own merit. Catholic, Orthodox, and some Anglican theologians have urged that we may participate in a process of being made holy in Christ through the Holy Spirit. This view emphasizes the actual transformation of the one who accepts the grace of God in faith. See Original Sin; see Justification; see Simul justus et peccator.",

        "Rings",
        "Christians have apparently worn finger-rings with Christian symbols since the third or fourth centuries. Rings have been associated with fidelity. There are several specific Christian uses of rings.Wedding Rings. It was a Roman custom for the man to give the woman a ring at the time of betrothal. The use of wedding rings by Christians is derived from this custom. Wedding rings may be exchanged by the husband and wife at the Celebration and Blessing of a Marriage (BCP, p. 427). These rings are signs of the vows by which the husband and wife bind themselves to each other. The rings are blessed by the priest at the marriage before they are exchanged by the man and woman. A ring may be given by the husband, the wife, or both. The giver of the ring places the ring on the ring-finger of the other&#8217;s hand, addresses the other by name, and says, &#8220;I give you this ring as a symbol of my vow, and with all that I am, and all that I have, I honor you, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit&#8221; (BCP, p. 427). The BCP allows an alternative ending, &#8220;in the Name of God,&#8221; for the trinitarian conclusion to the statement that is made when the ring is given. Another suitable symbol of the vows may be used instead of rings (BCP, p. 437). The BCP service for the Blessing of a Civil Marriage also includes a blessing of rings (p. 434).Episcopal Rings. In the late middle ages, the rite for the ordination of bishops came to include the delivery of instruments of office. An episcopal ring was given to the newly ordained bishop, along with staff and miter. The episcopal ring was a signet ring. It may have been used as an official seal. Some episcopal rings contained relics. The use of episcopal rings has been dated to the seventh century. At the ordination of a bishop in the Episcopal Church, a ring, staff, and miter, or other suitable insignia of office may be presented to the newly-ordained bishop. This follows the presentation of the Bible and the formula of presentation (BCP, p. 553). Modern episcopal rings are often made of gold and ornamented with an amethyst. The episcopal ring is usually worn on the ring-finger of the bishop&#8217;s right hand. Similar rings are worn by abbots and some abbesses.Rings are also worn by professed members of religious orders. Some Christians wear rings with Christian symbols as an expression of devotion. Rosary rings have ten small knobs which are used in saying the rosary.",

        "Rite",
        "A form for religious ceremony. It includes both what is said and what is done in the religious observance. Rite expresses the church&apos;s relationship with God through words, actions, and symbols. It orders the church&apos;s common worship. Rite enables the community to share its faith and experience God&apos;s presence in a particular liturgical and pastoral context. Divine transcendence is to be known through participation in the specific and finite realities of rite.Rites are prescribed for various sacraments, offices, and occasions in liturgical churches such as the Episcopal Church. The rites of the Episcopal Church are found in the BCP. Authorized services and texts for optional use are found in the BOS. Other rites may be approved for trial use prior to full approval for use in the worship of the church. The term may also designate a particular collection of liturgies. In the 1979 BCP, Rite 1 liturgies are traditional language services and Rite 2 liturgies are contemporary language services.   &#8220;Rite&#8221; may also identify a church or denomination that uses a particular rite or rites, such as &#8220;Byzantine Rite.&#8221; The term &#8220;rite&#8221; may also indicate the form for any solemn ceremony or practice.

        "Rite 1, Rite 2",
        "The 1979 BCP provides the services of Morning and Evening Prayer, the Holy Eucharist, and the Burial Office in both traditional language and contemporary language rites. The traditional language rites are known as Rite 1, and the contemporary language rites are known as Rite 2. The BCP also presents the collects for the church year in both traditional and contemporary language. The Rite 1 liturgies reflect the language and piety of the Elizabethan era and the first BCP, although the structure of these liturgies also reflects the influence of modern liturgical scholarship. The Rite 2 liturgies reflect more fully the influence of the liturgical movement and contemporary theology. Rite 2 liturgies tend to reflect greater sensitivity for inclusive language issues. The proper liturgies for special days (such as Ash Wednesday and Palm Sunday), pastoral offices (such as the Celebration and Blessing of a Marriage), and episcopal services (such as ordinations) are printed in contemporary language in the BCP. When these services are celebrated in the context of a Rite 1 Eucharist, the contemporary idiom may be conformed to traditional language (BCP, p. 14). The Hymnal 1982 and The Hymnal 1982 Accompaniment Edition, Vol. 1, provide service music settings that are designated for Rite 1 and Rite 2 services of Morning and Evening Prayer and the Eucharist.Although the structure of Rite 1 and Rite 2 liturgies are essentially the same, the options and requirements of the rites differ in certain respects. For example, the Rite 1 Eucharist requires the collect for purity in the entrance rite (BCP, p. 323), but the collect for purity may be omitted in Rite 2 (BCP, p. 355). The summary of the Law is optional in the Rite 1 Eucharist, but it is not included as an option in the Rite 2 Eucharist. The prayer for the whole state of Christ&#8217;s Church and the world (BCP, pp. 328-330) is presented as an option in the Rite 1 Eucharist, but this prayer is not included in the Rite 2 service. The BCP also provides six forms for the prayers of the people which may be done in traditional or contemporary language. The Rite 1 Eucharist includes two biddings to confession, the first of which dates to 1548. This bidding begins, &#8220;Ye who do truly and earnestly repent you of your sins&#8221; (BCP, p. 330). It is not found in the Rite 2 Eucharist. The Rite 1 Eucharist allows one or more of four sentences of scripture to be said after the confession and absolution. These sentences, previously known as the &#8220;comfortable words,&#8221; do not appear in the Rite 2 Eucharist. The Agnus Dei and the prayer of humble access may be said after the breaking of the bread in the Rite 1 Eucharist (BCP, p. 337). These prayers are not presented as options in the Rite 2 Eucharist, although a suitable anthem may be used after the breaking of the bread. A blessing by the bishop or priest is required after the postcommunion prayer in the Rite 1 Eucharist, but this blessing is optional in the Rite 2 Eucharist (BCP, pp. 339, 366).",

        "The nickname given to &#8220;An Order for Celebrating the Holy Eucharist&#8221; (BCP, pp. 400-405). This rite is in the form of an outline that allows the participants to prepare many of the liturgical texts that will be used in the eucharistic celebration while maintaining the same basic structure of the eucharistic liturgy that is found in other rites. The other eucharistic liturgies are designated &#8220;Rite 1&#8221; (traditional) or &#8220;Rite 2&#8221; (contemporary). &#8220;Rite 3&#8221; liturgies are &#8220;not intended for use at the principal Sunday or weekly celebration of the Holy Eucharist&#8221; (BCP, p. 400). The outline format of the rite allows flexibility that may be very appropriate for special occasions such as small weekday celebrations of the eucharist, and liturgies with a particular thematic emphasis or concern. The BCP provides two forms for the Great Thanksgiving in the Order for Eucharist. The BCP also allows flexibility in the services for marriage and burial.

        "Liturgical texts and ceremonies of divine worship. The term originally indicated the prescribed words of worship, but it came to include the entire liturgical action and presentation of the rite. The nineteenth-century ritualist controversy in the Episcopal Church included disputes over such practices as the use of processional crosses, altar lights, eucharistic vestments, incense, genuflection before the Blessed Sacrament, and elevation of the consecrated elements at the eucharist. In The Law of Ritualism (1866), Presiding Bishop John Henry Hopkins urged that a wide variety of ritual usage is permissible in the church. James DeKoven also appealed for comprehensiveness and tolerance in worship. He defended the ritualist cause at the 1871 and 1874 General Conventions. He urged that such practices as altar lights, genuflections, and the use of incense do not symbolize the doctrine of transubstantiation. Although DeKoven&apos;s position was not upheld in the canonical battle at the 1874 General Convention, his vision of a comprehensive approach to ritual prevailed in the Episcopal Church.

        "Ritualism",
        "Ritual refers to the prescribed form of words of an act of worship and also has been used to indicate the ceremonial of worship. The term &#8220;ritualism&#8221; was applied to the ceremonial enrichment of public worship by re-introducing pre-Reformation ceremonial practices into Anglicanism. These included practices at the eucharist such as the use of vestments, a processional cross, altar lights, incense, the mixed chalice, and liturgical actions such as genuflection and the elevation of the host for adoration. Those who supported the advance of ritualism were known as &#8220;ritualists.&#8221;The early stages of the Oxford Movement emphasized the recovery of catholic beliefs and ideas rather than ceremonial. But the renewed emphasis on catholic theology led to an expanding use of catholic practices and forms in the mid-nineteenth century. The advance of ritualism became intensely controversial in the Episcopal Church. Some opponents of ritualism believed the changes were introducing Roman Catholic practices and beliefs into a Protestant Church. Evangelicals were often strong and vocal opponents of ritualism. For many years, Bishop Manton Eastburn of Massachusetts refused to visit the Church of the Advent, Boston, because of the parish&#8217;s ritual practices. This dispute eventually led to a canon passed by the 1856 General Convention requiring a bishop to visit every parish in the bishop&#8217;s jurisdiction at least once every three years. The controversy over ritualism led John Henry Hopkins, Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, to publish The Law of Ritualism(1866). Hopkins urged that a wide variety of ritual uses were canonically permitted in the Episcopal Church. He predicted that many of the controverted practices would eventually be accepted.Proposed canons on ritual were considered at the General Conventions of 1868 and 1871, but no canons on ritual were enacted. However, resolutions condemning ceremonies expressing doctrines foreign to the church were adopted at the 1871 General Convention, and the pastoral letter of the House of Bishops condemned the new ritualism. Ritualism was one of the issues that led some radical evangelicals into schism from the Episcopal Church in 1873. George David Cummins, Assistant Bishop of Kentucky, and others organized the Reformed Episcopal Church. The General Convention of 1874 did pass a canon on ritual. Many hoped this would satisfy the evangelicals, and prevent further departures from the Episcopal Church. This canon called for a bishop to investigate any use of ceremonies or practices in the bishop&#8217;s jurisdiction symbolizing &#8220;false or doubtful doctrine.&#8221; The bishop was empowered first to admonish and then bring to trial any member of the clergy who persisted in these practices. However, this canon did virtually nothing to slow the expansion of ritual practices in the Episcopal Church. Only one trial for ritualism took place. In 1877 Oliver Prescott received episcopal admonishment for his ritual practices. The canon on ritual was quietly repealed at the 1904 General Convention.James DeKoven was a distinguished defender of ritual practices and a strong advocate for ritualism at the 1871 and 1874 General Conventions. At the 1871 General Convention, he argued that ritual practices do not symbolize the doctrine of transubstantiation. He noted that such practices preceded the doctrine of transubstantiation. These practices were shared by Orthodox and Lutheran churches that denied transubstantiation. At the 1874 General Convention, DeKoven urged the church to adopt a comprehensive approach to worship. The canon on ritual was passed despite DeKoven&#8217;s plea for comprehensiveness. His defense of ritualism led his opponents to question his theology of the eucharist and block his election as Bishop of Illinois. However, DeKoven&#8217;s vision of comprehensiveness in worship ultimately prevailed in the Episcopal Church. His life and ministry are commemorated on Mar. 22 in the Episcopal calendar of the church year. Many of the ritualist practices and actions that were controversial in the nineteenth century are now generally accepted.

In place of the earlier emphasis on reason, order, and mechanism there came to be an emphasis on feeling, mystery, the transcendent, vitality, the individual, and the brooding power of nature. Romantic religion upheld the continuity of tradition and community.The movement takes its name from a new appreciation of medieval romances, a literary genre involving tales of chivalric adventure. This turn to the culture of the middle ages can be seen in the beginnings of the liturgical movement. A revival of plainsong took place under Prosper Guéranger at the monastery of Solesmes. Romanticism influenced the theologians of the Oxford Movement and the Cambridge ecclesiologists. Its influence was also felt in the Episcopal Church. It lay behind the Ritual Controversy and the eventual recovery of certain aspects of catholic worship in the BCP.James DeKoven, a priest and warden of Racine College, has been identified as a representative of romantic religion in the Episcopal Church. DeKoven&#8217;s religion was a faith of the heart which was not limited to rationality. His romantic religion led him to seek fullness of beauty and mystery in worship. He was dedicated to liturgy, sacraments, and ceremonial. DeKoven was a forceful advocate for comprehensiveness and tolerance in worship at the 1871 and 1874 General Conventions.

        "(Jan. 30, 1882-Apr. 12, 1945). Thirty-second President of the United States, 1933-1945. He was the leader of the United States in the face of the Great Depression and World War II. Roosevelt was baptized at St. James&apos; Episcopal Church, Hyde Park, New York, and later served as senior warden of St. James&apos;. He graduated from Groton School and Harvard. He attended Columbia University School of Law, but discontinued his schooling after he was admitted to the New York bar. He was elected to the New York State Senate in 1910 and appointed Assistant Secretary of the Navy in 1913. Roosevelt was stricken with poliomyelitis in 1921, but his illness did not prevent his career of public service. He was elected governor of New York in 1928, and reelected in 1930. Roosevelt sought to give tax relief for farmers. He sought to use the resources of the state government to help the economy. He established state relief agencies and sought to provide cheaper public utilities for consumers. He was elected president in 1932 and inaugurated in 1933. In his first inauguration address as president he urged that &#8220;the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.&#8221; He sought to counter the ravages of the Depression with a sweeping economic program known as the New Deal. The programs of the New Deal sought to restore farm prosperity and restore business enterprise, along with providing relief, loans, and jobs through a variety of federal agencies. Federal agencies established during this time included the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the National Recovery Administration, and the Agricultural Adjustment Administration. Roosevelt was also the first president to appoint a woman, Frances Perkins, as a member of the Cabinet. Before the United States entered World War II, Roosevelt provided assistance to Great Britain and its allies through the Lend-Lease Act. He also denied war supplies to Japan. As President of the United States during World War II, Roosevelt played a leading role in creating the alliance with Great Britain and the Soviet Union. He was reelected president in 1936, 1940, and 1944. He died in Warm Springs, Georgia.",

        "Rosary",
        "A Marian devotion that leads to Jesus. It combines repetitions of familiar prayers with meditation on fifteen mysteries of faith. Meditation on each mystery is accompanied by recitation of the Lord&apos;s Prayer, ten (a &#8220;decade&#8221;) Hail Marys, and the Gloria Patri. The mysteries are divided into three sets of five, which are known as chaplets. Each chaplet or third of the rosary may be done separately. The terms &#8220;rosary&#8221; and &#8220;chaplet&#8221; may also be applied to the string of beads that is often used to aid the memory and count the prayers of this devotion. The three chaplets are the joyful mysteries which focus on the Incarnation, the sorrowful mysteries which focus on Christ&apos;s sufferings, and the glorious mysteries which focus on Christ&apos;s glorification. The five joyful mysteries are the Annunciation, the Visitation, Christ&apos;s Nativity, the Presentation of Christ in the Temple, and the finding of the child Jesus in the Temple. The five sorrowful mysteries are Christ&apos;s agony in the garden at Gethsemane, Christ&apos;s scourging, the crowning with thorns, the carrying of the cross, and the crucifixion. The five glorious mysteries are Christ&apos;s Resurrection, the Ascension, the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, the assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and the coronation of the Blessed Virgin Mary.Pious belief that the rosary was founded by St. Dominic (1170-1221) dates from the fifteenth century. This belief has not been proven by historical evidence. The rosary developed from christological and marian devotions from the twelfth to sixteenth centuries when its current form became standardized. Dominicans have encouraged the popularization of the rosary, and it is also known as the Dominican rosary. Use of this devotion is much more widespread and traditional in the Roman Catholic Church than in the Episcopal Church.  &lt;!&#8211; <span class=\"textSmall\">Line Number: 2</span> &#8211;&gt;",

Wheel windows were formed by straight bars which intersected like the spokes of a wheel to form geometric patterns. The design of these bars eventually became more delicate, with the tracery resembling an open rose. Rose windows may reflect the influence of the decorated circular forms of Muslim architecture that were seen by crusaders. Rose windows are characteristic of gothic cathedrals.

Peter Lombard (c. 1095-1160) identified these seven rites as sacraments of the church. This position was affirmed by the Council of Florence (1439) and the Council of Trent (1545-1563). The Orthodox Church also accepts seven sacraments. Martin Luther (1483-1546) was willing to identify Reconciliation of a Penitent as a sacrament, in addition to Baptism and Eucharist. In 1521 Henry VIII was awarded the title &#8220;Defender of the Faith&#8221; by Pope Leo X in recognition of Henry&apos;s treatise Assertio Septem Sacramentorum (Assertion of the Seven Sacraments) which defended the doctrine of the seven sacraments against Luther. After the English Reformation, Marriage or the Reconciliation of a Penitent are presented as sacraments by some Elizabethan homilies and formularies.

In the NT, the term is applied to all faithful Christians (see Acts 9:32, 26:10). Paul addresses the saints or those called to be saints who are the members of Christian communities that receive his letters (see Rom 1:7, 1 Cor 1:2, 2 Cor 1:1, Eph 1:1, Phil 1:1, Col 1:2). Christ makes it possible for us to be saints as we share his life. We are washed, sanctified, and justified &#8220;in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God&#8221; (1 Cor 6:11).The term later came to be applied to &#8220;elite&#8221; Christians whose lives were distinguished and exemplary because of their self-sacrifice, witness, virtue, or accomplishments. Special recognition was given to the martyrs of the early church. A feast of All Martyrs dates from at least the third century. The saints were the heroes of the church. The identification of saints as exceptional Christians has been associated with the legalization of Christianity and the growth of the church to include members who were not fervently committed to Christian faith. The celebration of All Saints&#8217; Day in the west dates from at least the ninth century. In the western church, the requirement for papal approval for canonization of a saint dates from the twelfth century. An elaborate and complicated process for canonization developed in the Roman Catholic Church. A multiplication of saints&#8217; days followed the establishment of Christianity in the Roman world. This may reflect a need to provide a Christian alternative to days of celebration for pagan gods and heroes. The saints came to be seen as protectors and intercessors rather than witnesses for the Christian faith. Saints&#8217; days proliferated in the western church during the middle ages. Churches and institutions were named for saints. Many faithful people made pilgrimages to shrines of saints, such as the shrine of Thomas Becket at Canterbury.Lutheran church orders restricted holy days to feasts of our Lord, the days of apostles and evangelists, St. Stephen, the Holy Innocents, St. John the Baptist, St. Michael the Archangel, and All Saints. The BCP followed the example of the German church orders, although other observances were later added. The calendar of the church year of the 1979 BCP includes the names of saints and many others whose lives are commemorated with feasts (pp. 15-33). The BCP provides collects, psalms, and lessons for holy days, including apostles such as St. Andrew (Nov. 30) and evangelists such as St. Mark (Apr. 25). The BCP also provides collects, psalms, and lessons for the Common of Saints for commemoration of saints listed in the calendar for which no proper is provided in the BCP (pp. 246-250, 925-927), including propers such as &#8220;Of a Martyr&#8221; and &#8220;Of a Missionary.&#8221; Lesser Feasts and Fasts provides collects, psalms, and lessons for commemorations in the calendar that do not have propers appointed by the Prayer Book, such as Nicholas Ferrar (Dec. 1) and John Henry Hobart (Sept. 12).

Salomon received his doctoral degree in history from the University of Berlin in 1907, and then served as research assistant for the Monumenta Germaniae Historica. From 1919 until 1934, he was professor of history at the University of Hamburg, but he was dismissed from that position by the Nazis. He was a foe of Adolf Hitler, and left Hamburg for the United States in 1937. He lectured at the University of Pennsylvania, Swarthmore College, and Bryn Mawr College, before he joined the faculty of Bexley Hall in 1939 as the Cooke Professor of Ecclesiastical History. He remained in this position until he retired in 1961. He was also professor of history at Kenyon College. He served as the official historiographer of the Diocese of Ohio and as unofficial historiographer of Kenyon College. One of his major publications was his editing of William White&apos;s The Case of the Episcopal Churches in the United States Considered (1953).

        "A liturgical dialogue of mutual greeting: &#8220;The Lord be with you.

This dialogue of greeting and response is based on Boaz&apos;s greeting to the reapers and their answer in Ru 2:4. At the Holy Eucharist, a salutation precedes the collect of the day at the beginning of the liturgy of the word (BCP, p. 357). A second salutation precedes the sursum corda at the beginning of the liturgy of the table (BCP, p. 361). A salutation also begins the thanksgiving over the water at Baptism (BCP, p. 306). It precedes the collect at Confirmation (BCP, p. 413), Burial (BCP, p. 493), and Ordination (BCP, p. 515), and begins the ministry of the word at Marriage (BCP, p. 425). A salutation precedes the Lord&apos;s Prayer at Morning Prayer (BCP, p. 97) and Evening Prayer (BCP, p. 121). A salutation is also included at the blessing of the palms on Palm Sunday (BCP, p. 271), in the Exsultet at the Easter Vigil (BCP, p. 286), and at the consecration of the font in the Consecration of a Church (BCP, p. 570).",

        "Salvation",
        "Eternal life in the fullness of God&#8217;s love. Salvation is deliverance from anything that threatens to prevent fulfillment and enjoyment of our relationship with God. In the OT, God was experienced as the savior who delivered Israel from bondage in Egypt (Ex 14-15; See Canticle 8, The Song of Moses, BCP, p. 85; Dt 6:21-23). Salvation history is the ongoing story of God&#8217;s activity and initiative for salvation. The OT records how God reached out to save the people of Israel through the law and the prophets. God&#8217;s saving deeds in OT history are celebrated in the liturgy of the word at the Easter Vigil (BCP, pp. 288-291).Christians affirm that the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus constitute the climax of salvation history. Jesus is our savior who redeems us from sin and death. As we share Christ&#8217;s life, we are restored to right relationship with God and one another. Despite our sins and insufficiency, we are made righteous and justified in Christ. We share the saving benefits of Jesus&#8217; victory over sin and death. Without God&#8217;s help for our salvation, we die with Adam. But we live in Christ as we share his life by faith (1 Cor 15:22). Christ has &#8220;brought us out of sin into righteousness, out of death into life&#8221; (BCP, p. 368).Salvation in Christ is made available to us through the Spirit, especially in the life and sacraments of the church. By the water of baptism, we are buried with Christ in his death and share his resurrection (BCP, p. 306; see Rom 6:3-4). The consecrated elements of the eucharist are for God&#8217;s people &#8220;the bread of life and the cup of salvation,&#8221; by which we share the body and blood of Christ (BCP, pp. 363, 375; see Jn 6:53-56; 1 Cor 10:16-17).The gospel proclaims the good news of salvation in Christ (see Jn 3:16-17). We may participate in a saving process of sanctification by which the saving life of Christ is increasingly the reality of our own lives. This process is completed and revealed in Christ, and it is begun in us through faith in him. Completed union with God is the end of this saving process. In Christ, we come to be at one with God. This union with God is not yet completed, and the eschatological Kingdom of God is not yet fulfilled. But the coming of the Kingdom of God has been inaugurated by Christ. The Kingdom of God was revealed in Jesus, who ate with outcasts, forgave sinners, healed the sick, and raised the dead (see Lk 5:17-32; Jn 11:1-44).We are now in the &#8220;in between times.&#8221; We can know the present reality of salvation in Christ, even though the Kingdom of God is not yet complete in our world, our church, or our hearts. The fulfillment of the Kingdom of God is associated with Jesus&#8217; second coming in power and glory. Our hope is that all humanity and all creation will be united in God&#8217;s love in the fullness of time, and that &#8220;nothing, not even death, shall separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord&#8221; (BCP, p. 862; see Rom 8:38-39).

The celebrant may introduce the scripture readings at the Easter Vigil with the invitation, &#8220;Let us hear the record of God&apos;s saving deeds in history, how he saved his people in ages past; and let us pray that our God will bring each of us to the fullness of redemption.&#8221; The concept is based on the German term Heilsgeschichte (history of salvation, or redemptive history).

        "Sanctification",
        "A theological term which derives from the Latin sanctus, &#8220;holy. In its proper sense &#8220;holy&#8221; refers to the holiness of God, but in a derived sense it applies to all those who are made holy. By extension it thus refers to all those who, in Christ, participate in the holiness of God through baptism. In the western or Latin theological tradition sanctification refers to the process of becoming holy through the transforming power of the Holy Spirit. At the time of the Reformation controversy arose about whether sanctification was to be considered a change made in a person, a process begun and continuing on through the sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit, or whether sanctifying grace was to be limited to the grace received at initial justification. Lutherans have tended to limit sanctification to the work of justification, while Calvinists have been willing to speak of sanctification in terms of obedience.Anglican formularies have tended to speak of sanctification as the process of God&apos;s work within us by means of which we grow into the fullness of the redeemed life. In the 1979 BCP, sanctification has been closely associated with the Holy Eucharist, as in the prayer of thanksgiving: &#8220;Sanctify us also that we may faithfully receive this holy Sacrament, and serve you in unity, constancy, and peace; and at the last day bring us with all your saints into the joy of your eternal kingdom&#8221; (Eucharistic Prayer A, BCP, p. 363); and: &#8220;We pray you, gracious God, to send your Holy Spirit upon these gifts that they may be the Sacrament of the Body of Christ and his Blood of the new Covenant. Unite us to your Son in his sacrifice, that we may be acceptable through him, being sanctified by the Holy Spirit&#8221; (Eucharistic Prayer B, BCP, p. 369).  ",

In modern times, churches have provided sanctuary for refugees and illegal aliens.

The term is used in the NT for any kind of quarrel or division. Its meaning was later restricted to divisions of the church having a non-doctrinal basis, such as divisions over disciplinary or organizational matters. Heresy is separation for doctrinal reasons. In the middle ages, the major schisms were that between east and west, which began in 1054, and that within the western (Roman) church from 1378-1417, when there were two Popes and then three. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the major schism has been that of the Old Believers in later seventeenth-century Russia. Today the term is generally used by the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches to refer to separations from themselves. In the Episcopal/Anglican and Protestant churches, the term is typically used to designate schisms within the church as a whole. In the Episcopal Church it is often said that the unity of the church was sundered by schisms that have separated the Orthodox, Roman, Anglican, and Protestant churches from one another in various ways. The earliest significant schism from the Episcopal Church was that of the Reformed Episcopal Church, which began in 1873.

It included such noted theologians and philosophers as Anselm, Peter Lombard, Abelard, Bonaventure, Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus, and William of Ockham.The name derives from the development in the middle ages of the great centers of learning, first in the monasteries and cathedrals, and later in the emerging universities. The medieval period was a time of considerable intellectual ferment, and the various &#8220;schools&#8221; of theology and philosophy debated and analyzed Christian faith in light of the emerging new learning.Scholasticism was especially important in two areas: the development of the science of logic and the analysis of the relationships between faith and reason, grace and nature, theology and philosophy. The schools differed in their analyses, but all shared a common conviction that the relationship of human beings to God needed systematic analysis. Among the Scholastics, Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventure have been the most important for the development of subsequent theology.The theological and philosophical work of Thomas Aquinas was of considerable importance for the Anglican Richard Hooker in his Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity. Hooker followed Aquinas&#8217;s basic teaching that reason is fulfilled in faith, the natural order in grace, and human law in the divine law. See Aquinas, Thomas; see Hooker, Richard.",

        "This word comes from the Latin for &#8220;writings&#8221; and refers to a collection of the most important documents in a given religious community. Many different religions have scriptures. The term &#8220;canon,&#8221; which means a rule or listing, refers to the list of items included in a scripture.The word &#8220;Bible&#8221; is used by Christians to refer to the OT and NT, the two parts of scripture. Other books, called the Apocrypha, are often included in the Bible (BCP, p. 853). In the Jewish tradition the OT is called Hebrew Scripture. When early Christians began to select writings for their scripture, they wanted to keep the Hebrew scripture and therefore chose to use the titles Old Testament (or covenant) for the Jewish writings and New Testament for the normative Christian writings. The Apocrypha is a collection of books written by people of the old covenant. The Articles of Religion note that these books may be read &#8220;for example of life and instruction of manners,&#8221; but are not used to establish any doctrine (Art. VI, BCP, p. 868). Selections from the Apocrypha are included in the BCP lectionaries for the Holy Eucharist and the Daily Office.The selection of writings to be included in the NT was not final until about 360 A.D. Some Christians did not want to include the Gospel of John or the Second Letter of Peter. After a long period of time, the currently accepted canon of scripture was determined on the basis of apostolic authorship or attribution and widespread acceptance of the texts included in the canon.All persons ordained as bishops, priests, or deacons in the Episcopal Church must solemnly declare at their ordination that they &#8220;do believe the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments to be the Word of God, and to contain all things necessary to salvation. . . .&#8221; (BCP, pp. 513, 526, 538). Scripture, along with tradition and reason, is one of the sources of authority in Anglicanism.

        "Seal of Baptism",
        "After baptism, the bishop or priest places a hand on the head of the newly baptized person, marking the forehead with the sign of the cross, addressing each one by name and saying, &#8220;You are sealed by the Holy Spirit in Baptism and marked as Christ&#8217;s own for ever&#8221; (BCP, p. 308). This marking of the newly baptized with the sign of the cross is also known as signation or consignation. Chrism may be used, but it is not required. The signation may be done immediately after the administration of the water at baptism, or it may follow the prayer for the gift of the Spirit after baptism (BCP, p. 308). This action is not performed by a deacon or lay person who administers baptism. If a deacon or lay person administers baptism in an emergency, the signation may be performed by a bishop or priest at the next public baptism.In Judaism, the newly baptized person was marked on the forehead with the Taw (T), the last letter of the alphabet, indicating the name of God. The newly baptized person was &#8220;branded&#8221; as God&#8217;s sheep, slave, and soldier. A similar post-baptismal practice continued in the Christian church with the sign of the cross on the forehead by which we are &#8220;marked as Christ&#8217;s own for ever.&#8221; The use of chrism is associated with incorporation into Christ, the &#8220;Anointed One.&#8221; It is also associated with the historic anointing of kings and priests, and the cleansing of a bath. The Apostolic Tradition of Hippolytus, dated about 215, indicates that the newly baptized were anointed and signed with a cross on their foreheads. The post-baptismal anointing was almost universal practice in the church by the late fourth or early fifth century. The 1549 Prayer Book included a post-baptismal anointing, but this was not continued in the 1552 BCP. A sign of the cross on the forehead replaced the post-baptismal anointing in the 1552 Prayer Book. The signation was made optional by the 1789 BCP, but it was once again required by the 1928 BCP. The 1979 BCP restored the rite of chrismation at baptism. The baptismal service includes a form for the consecration of the chrism by the bishop (BCP, p. 307). See Chrism.",

This translation of the Hebrew Bible is often designated by the Roman numerals LXX, which mean &#8220;seventy.&#8221; The term originally applied only to the translation of the Pentateuch. It was subsequently extended to include the rest of the Hebrew Bible. In spite of some of its fanciful details, most scholars agree that the legend preserves the authentic memory of the translation of the Pentateuch in Alexandria in the third century B.C. for Greek-speaking Jews. During the next two centuries in Egypt or elsewhere the Prophets and Writings were translated and the rest of the sacred books were composed. All were finished before the time of Christ.The Septuagint was used by writers of the NT, particularly the authors of Luke and Hebrews. It provided a bridge of language and ideas between the two testaments. Christian Bibles follow the order of books in the LXX rather than the Hebrew Bible. Since it apparently used a different and earlier version of the Hebrew Bible than the traditional Hebrew Masoretic Text (MT) used today, the LXX can frequently aid in interpreting difficult readings in the MT.",

        "Sequence",
        "A hymn sung after the second lesson and before the gospel acclamation at the eucharist. Many sequences were composed in the middle ages, but the Council of Trent (1545-1563) sought to streamline the liturgy and reduced the number of sequences to those for Easter, Pentecost, Corpus Christi, and the Mass for the Dead. The sequence Stabat Mater was reinstated by the Roman Catholic Church in 1727 for the Feast of the Seven Sorrows of the Virgin Mary, which was celebrated on Sept. 15. The historic sequences for Easter, Pentecost, Corpus Christi, and the Seven Sorrows of the Virgin Mary continue to be used in the Episcopal Church, although the feasts of Corpus Christi and the Seven Sorrows are not included in the Episcopal calendar of the church year. Those four sequences in The Hymnal 1982 include: for Easter, Victimae Paschali laudes, &#8220;Christians to the Paschal victim&#8221; (Hymn 183); for Pentecost, Veni Sancte Spiritus, &#8220;Come, thou Holy Spirit bright&#8221; (also known as &#8220;the Golden Sequence&#8221;) (Hymn 226); for Corpus Christi, Lauda Sion Salvatorem, &#8220;Zion, praise thy Savior, singing&#8221; (Hymn 320); and for the Feast of the Seven Sorrows of the Virgin Mary, Stabat Mater Dolorosa, &#8220;At the cross her vigil keeping&#8221; (Hymn 159). The Hymnal 1982 also provides a contemporary tune for &#8220;Come, thou Holy Spirit bright,&#8221; Arbor Street (Hymn 227).

The Agnus Dei originated in the east. It was based on Jn 1:29. Sergius also introduced in Rome the celebration of the feast of the Annunciation on Mar. 25. Celebration of this feast has been traced to the fifth century in the east. He introduced the use of a procession with candles and the singing of the Nunc dimittis for the Presentation of Our Lord Jesus Christ in the Temple on Feb. 2. The feast of the Presentation came to be known as &#8220;Candlemas.&#8221; Sergius also introduced a litany that had been used for private devotions in the east.

A community rule was adopted in 1354, and the Monastery of the Holy Trinity developed. Sergius served as abbot. Holy Trinity Monastery became the center for the renewal of Christianity in Russia, and the spiritual heart of Russian Orthodoxy. Holy Trinity became a model for Russian monasticism and a center for pilgrimage. Sergius founded forty monasteries. He refused election to the Patriarchate of Moscow in 1378.

        "Sermon",
        "Religious address in a worship service. The sermon is to &#8220;break open&#8221; the Word of God and proclaim the gospel in the context of the readings from scripture, the liturgical occasion, the congregation gathered, and the pastoral needs of the situation. The Christian story, the congregation&apos;s story, and the preacher&apos;s story can be the one story of God&apos;s love that is proclaimed in the sermon. A short sermon is often called a &#8220;homily.&#8221;The sermon was a regular part of the eucharist in the early centuries of the church. However, preaching had become infrequent by the late middle ages. Luther&apos;s Latin rite of 1523 called for a sermon to be preached at every eucharist. Sermons were preached in the churches of the Reformation on Sundays and during the week. But the integral connection of the sermon to the liturgy was obscured in many Protestant churches. The 1549 BCP required a sermon or the reading of a homily at each eucharist on a Sunday or holy day. The 1552 BCP made no exception to the requirement of a sermon on weekdays. The sermon came to be emphasized in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Anglicanism. Many colonial Anglican churches in North America were built with prominent pulpits. The ministry of preaching has at times been given special emphasis by evangelicals. The importance of the sermon was not emphasized by the nineteenth century liturgical revival in Anglicanism. However, the twentieth-century liturgical movement has tended to reclaim the sermon as an integral part of the liturgical celebration.   The 1979 BCP requires a sermon after the gospel at the eucharist. At a baptism, the sermon may follow the gospel or the peace. A sermon may be preached at the Daily Offices of Morning Prayer and Evening Prayer. The sermon may follow the readings at the Daily Office, or it may be preached at the time of the hymn or anthem after the collects, or it may follow the office.  ",

        "A collection of the teachings of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew (Chapters 5-7). It is the first of five special speeches in Matthew and takes place at the beginning of Jesus&apos; ministry. Many of the sayings in the Sermon on the Mount are also found in the Gospel of Luke. Scholars agree that this material probably comes from the Q source, even though the sayings are not in the same order or sequence. As a result, historical critics suggest that Matthew and Luke have two different ways of presenting Jesus&apos; teaching to their intended audience. Although the Sermon is addressed to the disciples, at the conclusion of the speech Matthew remarks that the crowd was amazed at Jesus&apos; teaching. Beginning with the beatitudes and followed by two metaphors, the main thesis is stated in 5:17-20. Jesus affirms the importance of the law but emphasizes the higher demands of a disciple: &#8220;Unless you show yourselves far better than the scribes and Pharisees, you can never enter the Kingdom of Heaven&#8221; (Mt 5:20). In this way Jesus describes the requirements of his followers at the beginning of his ministry. See Sermon on the Plain.",

The Service of Light may serve as a festal introduction to Evening Prayer, with the selection from the Psalter at Evening Prayer following the Phos hilaron. The Service of Light may also begin an evening eucharist, with the salutation and collect of the day following the Phos hilaron. This order of service is used for a eucharist on the Vigil of Pentecost (BCP, p. 227). The BOS also calls for this order of service to be used at a Vigil Eucharist for the Eve of the Baptism of our Lord, the Eve of All Saints&#8217; Day or All Saints&#8217; Sunday, or the Eve of Baptism. The BOS notes that the Service of Light introduces services for New Year&#8217;s Eve and All Hallows&#8217; Eve. It also may introduce Advent and Christmas Festivals of Lessons and Music. The short lesson of scripture may be omitted when one or more scripture lessons are to be read later in the service (BCP, p. 143).The term may indicate the opening section of An Order of Worship for the Evening (BCP, pp. 109-114). This Service of Light includes the entrance of the ministers into the darkened church, the opening acclamation or greeting, a short lesson of scripture, a prayer for light, the lighting of the candles, and the singing of the Phos hilaron (O Gracious Light). The Phos hilaronis the ancient candle-lighting hymn of the church. It has been associated with the use of incense. An appropriate anthem or psalm may be sung during the candle-lighting, or silence may be kept (BCP, p. 112). The Hymnal 1982 Accompaniment Edition, Vol. 1, provides a variety of candle-lighting anthems (Lucernaria) (S 305-S 320). The BOS also provides responsive texts for candle-lighting anthems. When the BOS Lucernaria are used, it is appropriate to omit the short lesson which precedes the prayer for light.The term also indicates the first part of the Great Vigil of Easter. This Service of Light includes the kindling of the new fire in the darkness, the opening collect, the lighting of the Paschal candle from the newly kindled fire, the procession to the chancel, and the Exsultet (BCP, pp. 285-287). The procession to the chancel is led by the deacon who bears the Paschal candle. This procession is led by the celebrant if there is no deacon. Candles held by members of the congregation may be lighted from the Paschal candle before it is placed in its stand. Other candles and lamps in the church, except for those at the altar, may also be lighted. The Altar Book provides music for the Exsultet, and the people&#8217;s responses are in The Hymnal 1982 (S 69).",

Since sin is faithlessness-the opposite of faith-it may be said that all sin is deadly rebellion against God. But it is difficult to conceive any sinful act that is not defined by one of these terms. In some sense this list is a categorization of sinful behavior described or implied by the decalogue (Ex 20:1-17 and Dt 5:6-21; see BCP, pp. 847-848) and by the great commandment given by Jesus in Matthew (22:34-40) concerning love for God and neighbor (see BCP, pp. 850-851). Pride has often been considered the chief and original sin since it beclouds all subsequent moral judgment. Covetousness, lust, envy, and gluttony may be considered self-destructive attempts to grasp what one seems to lack in order to achieve self-defined wholeness. In this the creature usurps the place of creator to become the author of one&apos;s own creation. Anger and sloth are thus the final terms of such fruitlessness-fury or despair at the failure of rebellion against God.",

Since Augustine human sexuality has been understood primarily in light of marriage and family by Christian ethics. The ends of human sexuality were understood thus in terms of procreation, mutual society, and the remedy of sin. Protestant reformers generally raised mutual society or companionship as the primary end of sexuality rather than procreation. Contemporary moralists have emphasized the positive end of pleasure rather than seeing pleasure as the occasion for sin and therefore in need of remedy. In addition to understandings formed by scripture and the moral tradition, contemporary sexual ethics are more broadly informed by historical studies as well as the natural and social sciences. Central questions in sexual ethics now include the nature of sexuality, sexual orientation, sexual identity, and gender identity; the historic and social diversity of sexual practices and relationships; and the effects of patriarchy and the need for justice, equality, and intimacy.",

        "Simul justus et peccator",
        "Latin phrase meaning &#8220;at once justified and a sinner.&#8221; It is associated with Martin Luther and Protestant thought concerning salvation. The righteousness of Christ is imputed to us by God and received by faith. We are thus justified by a righteousness that is extrinsic and alien to us personally. Although we are pronounced righteous by God in Christ, we continue to be sinners. In contrast, other views of salvation have emphasized that the righteousness of Christ is actually imparted and transformative for the one who receives God&apos;s grace in faith. Justification is thereby understood to involve a real change in the life of the believer through participation in an ongoing process of sanctification. In the sixteenth century the Roman Catholic Council of Trent upheld the transformation of the believer in the saving process, and contradicted simul justus et peccator. Contemporary theologians have moved beyond the polemics and caricatures of the sixteenth century. Many affirm the reality of a saving process involving participation in the unmerited gift of God&apos;s grace for salvation that is received by faith, and assert the ongoing need for human repentance.

        "Following our own will instead of following the will of God, thereby being centered on ourselves instead of God and distorting our relationships with God, other people, and creation (see BCP, p. 848). Sin is intentional disobedience and rebellion against God. It alienates us from our true selves. Sin is a misuse of human free will by one who is capable of choice (see BCP, p. 845). St. Paul states clearly that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God (Rom 3:23; see 1 Jn 1:8). The harm of sin is ultimately not in the bad act itself but in the damage caused by sin to one&#8217;s relationships with God and others. Sin is identified with death, as our life-giving relationship with God is impaired by sin (see Rom 6:23). Distortion of our relationship with God results in our loss of liberty as sin gains power over us (see BCP, p. 849). We may recognize our sin and need for redemption more clearly through the Ten Commandments and the biblical law (see BCP, p. 848). St. Paul also notes that the law can provide the occasion for sin, although the law is holy (see Rom 7:7-12). Roman Catholic thought has distinguished mortal (deadly) sins from venial (slight) sins, but Protestants have generally rejected this distinction.We participate in redemption from the power of evil, sin, and death through Jesus Christ who came into the world to save sinners (1 Tm 1:15; see BCP, p. 849). Jesus is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (Jn 1:29). He is our advocate with God the Father and the atoning sacrifice for our sins and the sins of the whole world (1 Jn 2:1). As we share in the death of Adam&#8217;s original sin, in Christ we may share in the victory of life over sin and death (1 Cor 15:22). The practice of Christian faith is concerned with receiving the grace of God&#8217;s forgiveness and new life in Christ. The BCP services for the Holy Eucharist and the Daily Offices all include forms for confession of sins (pp. 41-42, 62-63, 79-80, 116-117, 330-332, 360). Reconciliation of a Penitent is a sacramental rite of the Episcopal Church, and the BCP provides two forms for this rite (pp. 447-452). Forgiveness of sins concerns not just the removal of guilt but the restoration of personal relationships with God and others. See Original Sin; see Redeemer.",

Situation ethics often are dispositional ethics in which the right orientation of the will is important. Examples of such an ethic include Augustine&apos;s dictum &#8220;Love God and do what you will,&#8221; Luther&apos;s understanding of the freedom of the Christian given in faith active in love, and Karl Barth&apos;s emphasis on the uniqueness of the concrete command of God given anew in each situation and moment in time.

It disbanded in 1849. &#8220;Brother&#8221; Skiles, as he had come to be known, decided to remain in the region and continue his missionary work.

He moved to London and tried to make his way as a journalist. Every year from 1750 to 1755 he won the Seatonian Prize of Cambridge for a poem on a religious subject. He won the friendship of many of the artistic and literary &#8220;greats&#8221; of his day. In 1756 he was confined to an asylum for the first time. He was in and out of asylums from 1756 until his death in a debtor&apos;s prison. During lucid periods, however, he was able to work creatively. Smart produced several collections of poetry which provide the sources of texts found in contemporary hymnals.

Their tendency had been to concern themselves exclusively with individual salvation and economic prosperity. As a theological movement, it found its chief exponent in Walter Rauschenbusch (1861-1918). Rauschenbusch argued in A Theology for the Social Gospel (1917), a series of lectures given at Yale, that sin is more than individual. He understood sin to be the consequence of forces of evil in human society so that salvation must involve the redemption of the social order as well as the redemption of the individual. In this redemptive process, he argued, the churches have a critical role to play. The churches must exercise a prophetic commitment to redeeming the social order and show forth the presence of the Kingdom of God, which he understood as &#8220;a fellowship of righteousness.&#8221;While it could be said that the movement itself died, its continuing impact upon Protestant churches can be seen in the social action programs which have characterized much of mainline Protestantism since World War II.

Distributive justice considers the distribution of goods and burdens for the sake of the individual and the society as a whole. Social justice has most often focused on questions of distributive justice and the common good. The central question of social justice is, &#8220;On what basis are goods and burdens distributed fairly?&#8221; In fact, several bases or principles of justice indicate what is fair, depending upon what is being distributed. This includes individual need, merit or deserving effort, and benefit to the society as a whole. Justice is often complex since goods and services such as education or taxes are distributed on the basis of several principles. The Christian tradition has emphasized the intrinsic value or worth of the individual person. It has thereby claimed that justice requires meeting the basic needs of the individual and insuring that person&apos;s participation in society.

        "Soteriology",
        "Theology of salvation. Theological reflection on the meaning of salvation in Christ and how we may share salvation by faith. Salvation is eternal life in the fullness of God&apos;s love. In Christ, we are redeemed from sin and death and restored to right relationship with God. We are made righteous and justified in Christ, despite the inadequacy of our works for salvation. Salvation is deliverance from anything that threatens to prevent fulfillment and enjoyment of our relationship with God. Through the Spirit, especially in the life and sacraments of the church, we may share in Christ&apos;s life, death, and resurrection. We may participate in a saving process of sanctification by which the saving life of Christ becomes increasingly our own reality. This process is completed and revealed in Christ, and it is begun in us through faith in him. Completed union with God is the end of this saving process. In Christ, we come to be at one with God. Although this saving process is not yet completed, we look with hope for its fulfillment in the final coming of the kingdom of God. The Episcopal theologian William Porcher DuBose wrote The Soteriology of the New Testament (1892), which is a significant presentation of soteriology. See Atonement; see Heaven; see Redeemer; see Righteousness.",

        "Soul",
        "The spiritual nature of a human being, as distinguished from the bodily or physical nature. This distinction is reflected in Eucharistic Prayer I, which states, &#8220;here we offer and present unto thee, O Lord, our selves, our souls and bodies. . . .&#8221; (BCP, p. 336). Scriptural sources and Christian teaching have not always been clear or consistent concerning the soul. Aquinas, following Aristotle, identifies the soul as the metaphysical &#8220;form&#8221; of the body, which is its &#8220;matter.&#8221; Soul and body thus act jointly as co-principles of being and together constitute the human unity. The soul is understood to be directly created by God and immortal. It is meant to be united with a body. The soul is separated from the body at death, but understood to be capable of separate existence until reunited with a body at the resurrection of the dead. The BCP Catechism states that the resurrection of the body means that &#8220;God will raise us from death in the fullness of our being. . . .&#8221; (BCP, p. 862). In scholastic terms, this fullness of being is understood to include both the soul and a bodily nature. The modern understanding prefers to see body and soul as a substantive unity in which previous distinctions are blurred.",

        "Source Criticism",
        "Critical study of the sources of the NT gospels. Given the similarity yet individuality of the synoptic gospels, nineteenth-century scholars sought to find a way to determine the gospels&apos; historical connection to each other. They sought to determine the sources that were used by the authors of the gospels to produce the three distinct but similar stories of Jesus. Because we have no specific historical information about the author, time, or place of composition, the criticism is based on the texts of the gospels themselves. Therefore the solutions about the sources are suggested possibilities. There are two major accepted solutions: 1) Two Source Theory. Because much of Mark&apos;s material is found in Matthew and Luke, in the same basic sequence, and because Mark is much shorter than Matthew and Luke, it is argued that Mark was one of their sources. The second source identifies some other material in Matthew and Luke which is very similar but not found at all in Mark. It is called &#8220;Q,&#8221; from the German word for source, &#8220;Quelle.&#8221; Since both Matthew and Luke have material that is unique in each gospel, this theory also refers to sources &#8220;M&#8221; and &#8220;L.&#8221; The great majority of NT scholars accept the Two Source Theory. 2) Griesbach hypothesis. Because the &#8220;Q&#8221; source has never been found as a document, Matthew would be the earliest, used as a source by Luke. This view holds that Mark is the latest gospel, a condensed, compacted version of Matthew and Luke. See Synoptic Gospels.",

She had an early interest in the abolition of slavery and the temperance movement. Stanton attended the World&apos;s Anti-Slavery Convention in London with her husband, Henry Stanton, in 1840, where the exclusion of female delegates inspired a friendship with Lucretia Mott, a Quaker minister. In 1846 the family moved from Boston to Seneca Falls, New York. On July 19-20, 1848, she held a women&apos;s rights conference at the Wesleyan Methodist Church in Seneca Falls. Stanton met Susan B. Anthony in 1851, and from then until her death they worked together for women&apos;s rights. During the Civil War, Stanton founded the Women&apos;s Loyal National League, which supported the Union and gathered 300,000 signatures demanding the immediate abolition of slavery by constitutional amendment. When the American Woman Suffrage Association was founded in May 1869, she was chosen president and served in that capacity for twenty-one years.

The young Pharisee, Saul of Tarsus, witnessed Stephen&apos;s stoning and heard the martyr&apos;s prayer for his enemies. Saul eventually took up the work cut short by Stephen&apos;s death. Tradition says that Stephen&apos;s burial place was discovered on Dec. 5, 415, and that his bones were moved to Jerusalem on Dec. 26.

Although there is some precedent in pre-Christian Judaism for bringing these two commandments together, Jesus was apparently the first to formulate them precisely in this way as a summary of all the requirements of the Law (Mk 12:29-31). The Summary of the Law was first introduced as a substitute for the decalogue in the Nonjurors&apos; liturgy of 1718. It was taken into the Scottish liturgy of 1764, and from there it was adopted by the first American Prayer Book of 1789 as an alternative to the decalogue. It is retained in Rite 1 of the BCP and it is an option in the Penitential Order of both Rites I and II. The Summary of the Law is stated in the Catechism relative to the New Covenant (BCP, p. 851).",

        "Sunday Church School",
        "The first Episcopal Sunday Church School was opened in 1790 by James Milnor and Jackson Kemper at the United Parish of Christ Church and St. Peter&#8217;s, Philadelphia. William White was rector of the United Parish at that time. The Sunday School in the Episcopal Church became a conscious instrument for religious education in 1826 with the organization of the General Protestant Episcopal Sunday School Union. Its focus was catechetical, and its energy arose from the nineteenth-century evangelical impulse. The 1946 General Convention provided funding to undertake a complete overhaul of Sunday Church School programs. The Department of Christian Education developed a &#8220;new curriculum&#8221; under the leadership of the Rev. John Heuss. This new curriculum called on the Sunday Church Schools to encourage faith development. Sunday Church Schools continue to have an important place in the life of many Episcopal parishes.",

        "Sunday Letter",
        "One of the first seven letters of the alphabet, &#8220;A&#8221; through &#8220;g,&#8221; is assigned to each date in the calendar year (except Feb. 29) in rotation in the Prayer Book calendar (pp. 19-30). The letter &#8220;A&#8221; is assigned to Jan. 1, Jan. 8, Jan. 15, etc. The letter &#8220;b&#8221; is assigned to Jan. 2, Jan. 9, Jan. 16, etc. The Sunday Letter can be used to determine all the dates of the Sundays in a calendar year. For example, if Jan. 1 is a Sunday, &#8220;A&#8221; is the Sunday Letter. All dates in the table with the letter &#8220;A&#8221; will be Sundays. Leap Year presents the one exception to this rule. In a Leap Year, the letter corresponding to the date of the first Sunday in Jan. will be the Sunday Letter for the months of Jan. and Feb. However, the Sunday Letter for Mar. through Dec. in a Leap Year will be the letter preceding the Sunday Letter for Jan. and Feb. For example, if &#8220;g&#8221; is the Sunday Letter in Jan. and Feb. of a Leap Year, &#8220;f&#8221; will be the Sunday Letter in Mar. through Dec. of that Leap Year. This change results from the additional day (Feb. 29) in a Leap Year. The BCP provides a table for ready reference to the Sunday Letter of any year between A.D. 1900 and A.D. 2099 (pp. 880-881). It is possible to determine the date of Easter Day for any particular year in the calendar (pp. 21-22) by using the Golden Number and the Sunday Letter for that year (see Tables and Rules for Finding the Date of Easter Day, BCP, pp. 880-881). The Sunday Letter is also known as the Dominical Letter. Clergy and parishioners usually determine the dates of Sundays by consulting a printed calendar.",

        "A booklet prepared by the Standing Liturgical Commission and published by Church Hymnal Corporation in 1991 to supplement the existing Rite 2 liturgies of the BCP. It includes materials for Morning and Evening Prayer, complete eucharistic prayers, and forms for the eucharistic prayer for use with the Order for Celebrating the Holy Eucharist (BCP, pp. 400-401). These texts reflect awareness of the power of words and images in worship to shape our understanding of and relationship with God. The Preface for SLM identifies three stages in the evolution in awareness and understanding of liturgical language. The first stage of this process called for the use of &#8220;non-sexist&#8221; terms, in which gender specific words such as &#8220;he&#8221; and &#8220;man&#8221; were replaced with terms such as &#8220;God&#8221; and &#8220;humanity.&#8221; This stage was documented in Liturgical Texts for Evaluation (1987). The second stage involved the use of balanced language, including both masculine and feminine words, images, and metaphors. This stage was reflected in Supplemental Liturgical Texts, Prayer Book Studies 30 (1989). The third stage was seeking to challenge the church &#8220;to hear and use familiar and new passages and prayers in a different way.&#8221; In this stage, the language of liturgy was to be opened to new interpretation and the hearer opened to deeper meaning.",

Before the Council of Nicaea (325), synod and council were used interchangeably. After the Council of Nicaea, the term &#8220;council&#8221; was used for an ecumenical council and the term &#8220;synod&#8221; was used for a meeting of bishops. The Episcopal Church is divided into nine provinces. Each province has a Provincial Synod or a Synod of the Province. Each synod consists of a House of Bishops and a House of Deputies, which meets on a regular basis as determined by the province. Every bishop having jurisdiction within the province has a seat and voice in the House of Bishops of the province. The House of Deputies of a province consists of presbyters, deacons, and lay persons from each diocese and area mission in the province. The president of the province may be a bishop, presbyter, deacon, or lay person elected by the synod. In Oct. 1984 the Synod of Province VII elected Dixie Hutchinson president, the first lay person and first woman to be president of a province. Each province elects one bishop or presbyter or deacon and one lay person to the Executive Council of the Episcopal Church. Each Provincial Synod has the power to elect judges of the Provincial Court of Review. The convention of a missionary diocese may, in lieu of electing a bishop, request that the election of a bishop be made on its behalf by the Synod of the Province, or by the House of Bishops of the province subject to confirmation by the Provincial Synod.

Systematic theology may integrate philosophical, historical, scientific, economic, and humanistic studies. Although Anglicanism has not produced many comprehensive &#8220;systems&#8221; of theology, there have been notable exceptions. The Episcopal theologian William Porcher DuBose has been described as one of the few and one of the best systematic theologians in Anglicanism. DuBose&apos;s theology was rooted in the &#8220;turning points&#8221; of his life experience, and he described that relationship in his autobiographical and theological work Turning Points in My Life (1912).

        "Canticle of praise named for its opening words in Latin. It appears as Canticles 7 and 21 in the BCP (pp. 52-53, 95-96). The traditional language Canticle 7 is also known as &#8220;We Praise Thee,&#8221; and the contemporary language Canticle 21 is also known as &#8220;You are God.&#8221; This hymn of praise dates from the fourth century. Unlike most canticles, it is not based on scripture. It is usually attributed to Niceta (c. 392-414), Bishop of Remesiana in Dacia. It is mentioned in the Rule of Caesarius and the Rule of Benedict as the canticle at matins. The Sarum Breviary used it after the last lesson at Sunday matins except during Advent, Pre-Lent, Lent, and certain other days. The 1549 BCP called for its use after the OT reading at matins except during Lent. The 1979 BCP lists the Te Deum laudamus as one of three songs of praise which may begin the first eucharist of Easter (p. 294). The Table of Canticles suggests its use at Morning Prayer after the NT reading on Sunday, except during Advent and Lent, and after the NT reading on Feasts of our Lord and other major feasts (p. 144). It is traditionally used as the hymn of praise following the pontifical blessing and dismissal at the ordination of a bishop. The BOS calls for the Te Deum laudamus or other song of praise after the seating of a bishop in the cathedra of the diocese in the service for the Welcoming and Seating of a Bishop in the Cathedral. The BOS also suggests its use in other seasonal services such as a Vigil for All Hallows&apos; Eve and a Vigil for New Year&apos;s Eve. It has also been traditional to sing the Te Deum laudamus at other times of celebration outside the context of a liturgy, such as the election of a bishop at diocesan convention or a military victory. The Hymnal 1982 provides a variety of musical settings for both the traditional and contemporary versions of the Te Deum laudamus (S 205-S 207, S 282-S 288).

Temple was educated at Rugby and then at Balliol College, Oxford. In 1904 he became a fellow at Queen&apos;s College, Oxford. In 1906 he was refused ordination by Bishop Francis Baget of Oxford, who had doubts about Temple&apos;s theology of the Virgin Birth and the Resurrection. Temple was ordained priest in 1908. In 1910 he became the headmaster of Repton. In 1914 Temple became the rector of St. James&apos; Church, Piccadilly. During the war years he was secretary of the Mission of Repentance and Hope. He was later the leader of the Life and Liberty Movement. On Jan. 25, 1921, he was consecrated Bishop of Manchester. He served in that position until he became Archbishop of York on Jan. 2, 1929. On Apr. 1, 1942, Temple became the ninety-eighth Archbishop of Canterbury. He served in that position until his death. He was a leader in the ecumenical movement and a strong advocate of educational and labor reform. His chief publications were Mens Creatrix (1917) and his Gifford Lectures, Nature, Man and God (1934). His sympathetic attitude toward the working-class movement led him to membership in the Labor Party in 1918. His influential Christianity and Social Order (1944) is sometimes described as a twentieth-century adaptation of Christian Socialism and one of the underpinnings of the welfare state. He was chairman of an interdenominational and international Conference on Christian Politics, Economics, and Citizenship in 1924, an Anglican delegate to the Faith and Order Conference at Lausanne in 1927, and chairman of the Faith and Order Conference at Edinburgh in 1937. He was largely responsible for the British Council of Churches and the formation of the World Council of Churches. Temple was an incarnational theologian and a leader in the social application of the gospel. He was noted for his ability to express complicated ideas clearly and persuasively.",

The Sinai version precedes the large collection of laws also associated with the Mosaic covenant. The Ten Commandments form the fundamental law of God for Israel and concern the cult (no other gods, no images, no misuse of God&apos;s name, observance of the Sabbath) as well as social relations (honor of parents, no killing, no adultery, no false witness, no coveting). Unlike the case law of the OT, where an offense is followed by its punishment, the Ten Commandments are categorical. Some religious communities differ from the numbering of the Ten Commandments in Anglican and reformed traditions, but agree in the content.

One candle is extinguished as each of the fourteen appointed psalms is completed. The fifteenth candle, symbolic of Christ, is left lighted at the end of the final psalm. But it is carried away to be hidden, which signifies the apparent victory of the forces of evil. A sudden loud noise is made at the end of the service, symbolizing the earthquake at Christ&apos;s death. The lighted candle is then restored to its place, suggesting Christ&apos;s eventual triumph.

These canonical hours of the breviary office were known as little hours or little offices. The early Christian church followed the Jewish custom of community prayers at sunrise and sunset, with private devotions at the third, sixth, and ninth hours (9 a.m., 12 noon, and 3 p.m.). These little hours of prayer were associated with the Passion. Jesus&apos; dying on the cross was recalled in the sixth hour, and his burial was recalled in the ninth hour. The custom of daily prayer is evidenced by Acts 3:1, which records that Peter and John &#8220;were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, at three o&apos;clock in the afternoon.&#8221; Acts 10:9 also states that Peter went to pray at noon on the day when the men sent by Cornelius arrived.

Development of the full round of canonical hours-including matins and lauds, prime, terce, sext, none, vespers, and compline-has been dated from the late fifth century. terce, sext, and none were not included in early Anglican Prayer Books.

There was also a Thanksgiving celebration with prayer by members of the Berkeley plantation, near what is now Charles City, Virginia, in 1619. The first national Thanksgiving Day was celebrated in 1789. Under President Abraham Lincoln, Thanksgiving Day came to be celebrated annually on the last Thursday of Nov. Thanksgiving Day was celebrated on the third Thursday of Nov. in the three years 1939-1941 under President Franklin D. Roosevelt. However, the Thanksgiving Day commemoration was moved back to the fourth Thursday in Nov. by Congress in 1941.Thanksgiving Day is a major holy day and a national day in the Prayer Book calendar of the church year (pp. 16-17, 33). The Proposed Prayer Book of 1786 included &#8220;A Form of Prayer and Thanksgiving to Almighty God, for the Fruits of the Earth, and all the other Blessings of his merciful Providence.&#8221; The first American Prayer Book (1789) replaced the four national days of the 1662 English book with propers for Thanksgiving Day.

        "The BCP (p. 439) states that after the birth or adoption of a child, the parents and other family members should come to the church to be welcomed by the congregation and give thanks to God. It is desirable that this be done at a Sunday service. The BCP provides a form for A Thanksgiving for the Birth or Adoption of a Child (pp. 440-445). It may follow the prayers of the people preceding the offertory at the eucharist. At Morning or Evening Prayer, it may take place before the close of the office. At the proper time, the celebrant invites the parents and other family members to present themselves before the altar. The BCP provides forms of address for the celebrant that are appropriate for the birth of a child or for an adoption. The form for an adoption also includes a formal inauguration of the new relationship. In response to a question by the celebrant, the parents take the child for their own. If the child is old enough to answer, the child accepts the woman and man as mother and father. The service continues with an Act of Thanksgiving, which includes the Magnificat, or Ps 116, or Ps 23. After a prayer of thanksgiving for the blessing bestowed on the family in the gift of a child (BCP, p. 443), the celebrant may add one or more additional prayers, including a prayer of thanks for a safe delivery, a prayer for the parents, a prayer for a child not yet baptized, or a prayer for a child already baptized. This form concludes with a threefold blessing of the family. This trinitarian blessing recalls that God the Father adopts us as his children by baptism, that God the Son sanctified a home at Nazareth, and that God the Holy Spirit has made the church one family (BCP, p. 445). A shorter form of this service may be used, especially in a hospital or at home. If the shorter form is used, the celebrant may begin with the Act of Thanksgiving, or with the prayer of thanksgiving for the blessing bestowed on the family in the gift of a child. A passage of scripture may first be read. The BCP identifies Lk 2:41-51 and Lk 18:15-17 as appropriate readings for this service. The service also includes a rubric that calls upon the minister of the congregation to instruct the people concerning the duty of Christian parents to provide for the well-being of their families and for all persons to make wills to arrange for the disposal of their temporal goods, including bequests for religious and charitable uses if possible (BCP, p. 445).Historically, there were prayers of ritual purification for women who had been through childbirth. This purification was also known as the &#8220;churching&#8221; of women. The service of purification was done at the entrance of the church in the Sarum rite. Similarly, the 1549 Prayer Book included &#8220;The Order of the Purification of Women.&#8221; This rite was known as &#8220;The Thanksgiving of Women after Childbirth, commonly called the Churching of Women&#8221; in the 1552 BCP, and in subsequent Prayer Books through the 1928 BCP.

It is drawn from Greek words meaning God and justice, and it justifies God&apos;s omnipotence, omniscience, and benevolence in the face of evil. Theodicies often emphasize the importance of human free will and moral responsibility, which allow the possibility of evil through destructive choices. Human virtue can also be understood to have meaning in terms of a choice for virtue despite possible failure and painful consequences-i.e., in the face of and in opposition to real evil. Human moral and spiritual development would be deprived of meaning if moral choices or favorable outcomes were somehow predetermined by God. The reality of free will allows us to choose to accept the offer of God&apos;s saving love. This response to the invitation of God&apos;s love would be meaningless if it were forced or unfree. Thomas Aquinas has been associated with the free will defense to the problem of evil. Leibniz believed this world to be the best of all possible worlds and held that evil provides a necessary contrast to disclose beauty and harmony.

As distinct from the cardinal virtues which we can develop, the theological virtues are the perfection of human powers given by the grace of God. Cited first in 1 Cor 13:13, faith, hope, and love are described as theological virtues by Augustine. This tradition reaches its culmination in the thought of Thomas Aquinas. In his Summa Theologica, Thomas places faith, hope, and love at the center of his understanding of grace and sanctification or the deepening of the person&apos;s relationship with God. Faith is a matter of knowledge of God which perfects the intellect. Faith thereby perfects all human powers by orienting them to the final end or purpose of life. Hope is a matter of the perfection of the will. What is known in terms of hope is not narrowly an object of knowledge but a power that animates and sustains human willing. Love is a matter of perfection itself as love is the perfection of all powers. Richard Hooker, Jeremy Taylor, and other Anglican divines of the seventeenth century assumed this framework in terms of the theological virtues. Kenneth Kirk also used this understanding in seeking the renewal of Anglo-catholic moral theology in the twentieth century.",

As stated by Cyril of Alexandria, &#8220;We are made partakers of the divine nature and are said to be sons of God. . . not only because we are exalted by grace to supernatural glory, but also because we have God dwelling in us.&#8221; The saving benefit of theosis is rooted in the Incarnation and the activity of divine grace.

Theosis is associated with the gift of divine glory (Jn 17:5, 22-24), adoption as children of God by the indwelling Spirit (Rom 8), and participation in the divine nature (2 Pt 1:4).Although theosis has not been emphasized in Anglican theology of salvation, it is compatible with William Porcher DuBose&#8217;s understanding of humanity&#8217;s destined union with God through the saving process of divine grace. Richard Hooker emphasized the theological significance of sacramental participation in Book V of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity. An understanding of theosis is also implicit in the collect for the Second Sunday after Christmas Day, which prays, &#8220;Grant that we may share the divine life of him who humbled himself to share our humanity, your Son Jesus Christ. . . .&#8221; (BCP, p. 214).

A Franciscan third order was created as an association of lay persons remaining in the secular world. They were admitted to participate in the spiritual life of the communities. Subsequently other religious orders created their own third orders. The Society of St. Francis in the Episcopal Church includes a third order.

        "Thirty-Nine Articles, or Articles of Religion",
        "The Thirty-Nine Articles were the result of a long process in which the Church of England attempted to provide a theological foundation for its existence during the doctrinal conflicts of the sixteenth century. The conflicts arose from the competing views between Protestants and Roman Catholics as well as controversy within the Church of England itself. The Articles are not a creed nor are they a confessional statement such as those produced by the churches of the Reformation. They seek only to provide a basic consensus on disputed points and to separate the Church of England from certain Roman Catholic doctrines which were regarded as medieval abuses or superstitions. At the same time, however, they affirmed other aspects of Christian belief which were held in the Roman Catholic Church.The Articles have always been subjected to a variety of interpretations by those who emphasized their Reformation heritage and by those who interpreted the Articles in a more catholic manner. The most controversial interpretation of them was made by John Henry Newman in his Tract 90. He was at that time a leader of the Oxford Movement. Newman interpreted the Articles virtually in accordance with the teaching of the Council of Trent. Shortly after writing Tract 90, Newman joined the Roman Catholic Church.The Church of England required the clergy to subscribe to the Articles until the last century. Subscription to the Articles is now required only in a general sense in the Church of England. The Episcopal Church has never required subscription to the Articles. They now appear in a section called &#8220;Historical Documents&#8221; in the back of the BCP (pp. 867-876). The status and authority of the Articles has often been a subject of debate among Anglicans. The Articles have also been a source of confusion for those non-Anglicans who want to know what may be the authoritative teaching of the Anglican Church.",

It was run by the Brethren of the Common Life, who stressed the necessity of imitating the life of Christ by loving one&apos;s neighbor as oneself. He entered the Augustinian Convent of Mt. Saint Agnes near Zwolle, the Netherlands, in 1399. Kempis took his vows in 1407, and was ordained priest in 1413. In 1429 he became subprior of this community and spent the rest of his life there. He is renowned chiefly as the probable author of the Imitatio Christi, the Imitation of Christ. It is a manual of devotion to instruct the Christian in seeking perfection by following Christ as one&apos;s model. The book first appeared anonymously in 1418. It stresses asceticism rather than mysticism, and moderate rather than extreme austerity. Kempis died at the Convent of Mt. Saint Agnes.

Thomas boldly urges his fellow disciples to go with Jesus to Bethany in Judea, despite the dangers they will face. Thomas says, &#8220;Let us also go, that we may die with him&#8221; (Jn 11:16). At the Last Supper, Thomas tells Jesus that he does not know where Jesus is going, and asks, &#8220;How can we know the way?&#8221; (Jn 14:5). Thomas was absent at the time of Jesus&apos; first appearance to the disciples after the resurrection. Thomas did not believe the other disciples when they told him they had seen the Lord. He has been known as &#8220;doubting Thomas&#8221; because of his disbelief that Jesus had appeared to the disciples. Thomas needed proof to believe. He did believe when Jesus appeared to him and the other disciples a week later. Thomas responds to Jesus&apos; appearance by clearly proclaiming his faith, &#8220;My Lord and my God!&#8221; (Jn 20:28). Jesus said, &#8220;Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe&#8221; (Jn 20:29). Several apocryphal works have been attributed to Thomas, including the Gospel of Thomas. He is associated with the Christian mission to Parthia and India. Thomas&apos;s willingness to express his doubts and his faith in Jesus has provided a helpful example for many Christians. The BCP collect for Saint Thomas the Apostle prays that &#8220;our faith may never be found wanting&#8221; (BCP, p. 237).

The Three Persons subsist in the divine Essence, with which each is identical. Creation is a going out of the creature from God. The Incarnation of the Word, the institution of the church, the sacraments, the theological virtues of faith, hope, and charity, and the moral virtues are the normal means of the creature&apos;s return to God. Salvation is entirely God&apos;s gift. Eternal beatitude is given in a face-to-face vision of God in heaven. The English theologian Richard Hooker made use of Thomism. In 1879 Pope Leo XIII made Thomism the chief instrument of theological education in Roman Catholic seminaries.",

        "Tradition",
        "In Christian theology, tradition originally referred simply to that which had been handed down to the church from the prophets and the apostles concerning belief in God and God&apos;s redemptive work in Christ. Before the development of an authorized canon of Hebrew and Christian scriptures, the oral teaching of the Apostles and their successors formed the Christian tradition. Gradually, however, the term took on different meanings to include, for example, the authorized teaching of church councils and commonly accepted credal formulations. By the time of the middle ages it had taken on the sense of an authentic body of teaching in addition to scripture. Such an understanding of tradition was rejected by the Reformers, who appealed only to the authority of scripture itself. Article XXXIV of the Articles of Religion took a mediating position, admitting the authority of traditions so long as they were not &#8220;repugnant to the Word of God, and be ordained and approved by common authority.&#8221; Anglicanism reflects balance in its devotion to scripture, tradition, and reason as sources of authority.

        "Transfiguration of Our Lord Jesus Christ, The",
        "Feast that celebrates Jesus&#8217; radical change of appearance while in the presence of Peter, James, and John, on a high mountain (Mt 17:1-8; Mk 9:2-8; Lk 9:28-36). The Gospel of Matthew records that &#8220;he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his garments became white as light.&#8221; At this moment Moses and Elijah appeared, and they were talking with Jesus. Peter, misunderstanding the meaning of this manifestation, offered to &#8220;make three booths&#8221; for Jesus, Moses, and Elijah. A bright cloud overshadowed them and a voice from the cloud stated, &#8220;This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him.&#8221; The disciples fell on their faces in awe, but Jesus encouraged them to arise and &#8220;have no fear.&#8221; They saw only Jesus. This event is alluded to in 2 Pt 1:16-18, which records that &#8220;we were eyewitnesses of his majesty&#8221; and &#8220;we were with him on the holy mountain.&#8221; The Transfiguration revealed Christ&#8217;s glory prior to the crucifixion, and it anticipated his resurrection and ascension. It may have given strength and comfort to his disciples in the difficult times that followed. It also prefigures the glorification of human nature in Christ.Celebration of the Transfiguration began in the eastern church in the late fourth century. The feast is celebrated on Aug. 6. This was the date of the dedication of the first church built on Mount Tabor, which is traditionally considered to be the &#8220;high mountain&#8221; of the Transfiguration. Others locate the Transfiguration on Mount Hermon or the Mount of Olives. Celebration of the feast was not common in the western church until the ninth century. It was declared a universal feast of the western church by Pope Callistus III in 1457. The feast was first included in the English Prayer Book as a black letter day in the 1561 revision of the calendar of the church year. It was included as a red letter day with proper collect and readings in the American Prayer Book of 1892. Its inclusion reflects the efforts of William Reed Huntington, who wrote the BCP collect for the Transfiguration. This collect prays, &#8220;O God, who on the holy mount revealed to chosen witnesses your well-beloved Son, wonderfully transfigured, in raiment white and glistening: Mercifully grant that we, being delivered from the disquietude of this world, may by faith behold the king in his beauty. . . .&#8221; (BCP, p. 243). The Transfiguration is listed among the holy days of the church year as a Feast of our Lord. Other provinces of the Anglican Communion followed the lead of the Episcopal Church in celebrating the Transfiguration as a major feast. The Transfiguration gospel is used on the Last Sunday after the Epiphany in all three years of the BCP eucharistic lectionary. As an Epiphany story, the Transfiguration provides one of the most distinctive and dramatic showings of Jesus&#8217; divinity. The Hymnal 1982 provides several hymns for the Transfiguration, including &#8220;Christ upon the mountain peak&#8221; (Hymns 129-130) and &#8220;O wondrous type! O vision fair&#8221; (Hymns 136-137).

This eucharistic theology is based on the philosophical categories of Aristotle, elaborated at length by medieval Latin theologians, and regarded as definitive in the Roman Catholic tradition. The term is derived from the Latin trans &#8220;across&#8221; or &#8220;over,&#8221; and substantia, &#8220;substance.&#8221; The classical explanation of transubstantiation was presented by Thomas Aquinas in the Summa Theologica. Transubstantiation was also defended by the Fourth Lateran Council (1215) and the Council of Trent (1545-1563). Article XXVIII of the Articles of Religion rejected transubstantiation as &#8220;repugnant&#8221; and unscriptural, asserting instead that Christ is present in the eucharist in a &#8220;heavenly and spiritual manner&#8221; (BCP, p. 873). The English Test Act of 1673 required a Declaration Against Transubstantiation by all persons holding civil or military office. Some nineteenth-century Tractarians, such as John Henry Newman, found transubstantiation to be compatible with their understanding of the eucharist. But the concept of transubstantiation has generally been avoided and excluded from Anglican theologies of the Real Presence of Christ&apos;s body and blood in the eucharist.

        "Trial Use",
        "The process of Prayer Book revision has been ongoing since the sixteenth century. The first Episcopal Prayer Book began with a process of trial use. The 1786 Proposed Prayer Book was the basis for the 1789 BCP, which was the first official Prayer Book in the Episcopal Church. During the twentieth century in the Episcopal Church proposed revisions of the Prayer Book were used on a trial basis prior to final approval. The Standing Liturgical Commission was established by the 1928 General Convention and given significant responsibility for preparing materials needed for Prayer Book revision. In 1950 the Standing Liturgical Commission began publishing a series of Prayer Book Studies. A revised eucharistic rite was presented by the Standing Liturgical Commission to the 1967 General Convention. This proposed revision was approved for trial use. A series of rites was published as Services for Trial Use and authorized for use by the 1970 General Convention. It was known as the &#8220;Green Book&#8221; because of its green cover. Additional rites were authorized at the 1973 General Convention, and revised eucharistic rites, rites of initiation, orders for the Daily Office, and a complete revision of the Psalter were subsequently published as Authorized Services 1973. It was known as the &#8220;Zebra Book&#8221; because of its striped cover. The 1976 General Convention approved the full report of the Standing Liturgical Commission, known as the Draft Proposed Book of Common Prayer. This became the Proposed Book of Common Prayer. It was approved as the Standard Prayer Book by the 1979 General Convention. The process of trial use for Prayer Book revision continued after the 1979 BCP. The 1985 General Convention resolved that the Standing Liturgical Commission should prepare inclusive language liturgies for the regular services of the church. This process of study, development, and evaluation of inclusive language texts was continued by the 1988 General Convention, ultimately resulting in the publication of Prayer Book Studies 30-Supplemental Liturgical Texts (1989). The use of these texts was authorized by General Convention, with use limited by the direction of the diocesan bishop or ecclesiastical authority.",

In twenty-five sessions it dealt concurrently with doctrinal questions and church reform. Its doctrinal decrees explained scripture and tradition (1546), justification (1547), sacraments (1547, 1551, 1562, 1563), and purgatory (1563). Most decrees included anathemas on those who denied the doctrines, but the Reformers were not condemned by name. Tridentine church reforms obliged bishops to reside in their dioceses, created seminaries to train the clergy, outlawed clandestine marriages, initiated a moderate liturgical reform, and inspired the Roman Catechism (1566) and a revision of the text of the Latin Vulgate Bible (1592).

The 1871 General Convention discussed the role of women in the missionary and educational work of the church, and concluded that women needed a national organization. At the meeting of the Board of Missions in Oct. 1872, the Woman&apos;s Auxiliary to the Board of Missions was organized. At the 1874 General Convention, the first general meeting of the Woman&apos;s Auxiliary was held. It met annually for the next four years. Beginning with the General Convention of 1880, the Woman&apos;s Auxiliary met every three years when the General Convention met. This meeting was called the Triennial. It was called the &#8220;Third House&#8221; of the General Convention, along with the House of Deputies and the House of Bishops, although it had no canonical basis or authority. The United Offering, now called the United Thank Offering, was established at the 1889 General Convention. When the 1919 General Convention reorganized the Episcopal Church, the Woman&apos;s Auxiliary to the Board of Missions became the Woman&apos;s Auxiliary to the National Council, now called the Executive Council.

        "Trinity",
        "The Trinity is one God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (BCP, p. 852). The term is from the Latin tri, &#8220;three,&#8221; and unitas, &#8220;unity.&#8221; The term was devised by Tertullian to express the mystery of the unity-in-diversity of God. Trinity means &#8220;threefold unity.&#8221; The corresponding word in Greek is ho trias, which means &#8220;the Triad.&#8221; The Trinity is a perfect relationship of love in which neither unity nor distinctness of the divine persons is compromised. God&#8217;s life is understood to be dynamic, loving, and available to be shared in relationship with humanity for salvation. The term &#8220;economic Trinity&#8221; has been applied to the life of the Trinity in time and space, in the &#8220;economy&#8221; of salvation; as distinguished from the &#8220;immanent Trinity&#8221; which refers to the inner life of God beyond the limits of time and space. It may be said that our experience of the economic Trinity leads us to know the immanent Trinity and that God&#8217;s self-revelation corresponds to God&#8217;s essential nature. However, the helpfulness of this distinction should not be overemphasized because there is only one divine trinitarian life. Karl Rahner states, &#8220;The economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity, and vice versa.&#8221;Christian theology is the heir of both uncompromising biblical monotheism and the Platonic, Aristotelian, and Stoic emphases on the unity and simplicity of God. However, the NT ascribed a place of equality with God to the Word of God who became incarnate in Jesus of Nazareth (e.g., Jn 1:1-18, Col 1:15-20). The Spirit of God was also included in the divine life (1 Cor 2:10-13). The church took several centuries to work out a reasonably acceptable way to express the complex relation of Father, Son, and Spirit. The nearly complete doctrine of the Trinity announced at Constantinople in 381 held that God is one Being (ousia) in three equal and consubstantial persons or hypostases: the Father uncreated, the Son uncreated but begotten, the Spirit proceeding from the Father (and, in the western version of the Creed, the Son). The Athanasian Creed states that &#8220;we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity, neither confounding the Persons, nor dividing the Substance&#8221; (BCP, p. 864). Article I of the Articles of Religion affirms that in the unity of God &#8220;there be three Persons, of one substance, power, and eternity; the &#8220;Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost&#8221; (BCP, p. 867).

On Nov. 2, 1696, the vestry of the new Trinity Church called William Vesey to be the rector. King William III of England granted a charter and a land grant for Trinity Church. The annual rent was &#8220;one peppercorne&#8221; to be sent to the king. On Mar. 13, 1698, the first Trinity Church building, a modest rectangular structure, opened for worship. In 1705 Queen Anne and Lord Cornbury, governor of New York, gave Trinity Church a tract of land known variously as &#8220;Duke&apos;s Farm,&#8221; &#8220;King&apos;s Farm,&#8221; and &#8220;Queen&apos;s Farm.&#8221; This increased Trinity&apos;s holdings to 215 acres. Trinity later divested most of this land to establish and endow other churches and institutions, including what is now Columbia University. It also provided Trinity Church with a large endowment. In 1709 it founded the Charity School, now known as Trinity School. In Sept. 1776 the original church structure and the Charity School were destroyed by fire.

This hymn was used at the opening of the eucharistic rite in the east and in Gallican liturgies. It came to be used in the Roman rite as part of the reproaches on Good Friday. A paraphrase of the Trisagion was used in the anthem &#8220;In the midst of life,&#8221; which was included in the Burial Office of the 1549 BCP and all subsequent Prayer Books (see BCP, pp. 484-485, 492).

In 1867 he conducted a service in St. James&apos; Methodist Church in New Brunswick, New Jersey, without the permission of the local Episcopal clergy. This was contrary to canon law and custom in the Episcopal Church. The &#8220;intrusion&#8221; canon stated that no member of the clergy should officiate in another&apos;s parish without the express permission of the resident clergy. The two New Brunswick rectors from that parish, Alfred Stubbs and Edward Boggs, made a formal complaint to Bishop Horatio Potter of New York. A court of five New York clergy found Tyng guilty of &#8220;intrusion&#8221; and recommended public admonition. The decision was not a severe penalty, but it created a furor in the Episcopal Church. It became a cause in the Ritual Controversy of the period. On Mar. 14, 1868, Bishop Potter carried out the admonition of Tyng in the high church parish of the Church of the Transfiguration, New York. Several years later Bishop George D. Cummins left the Episcopal Church and formed the Reformed Episcopal Church. Tyng was persuaded by his father not to leave the Episcopal Church.

        "Validity (Sacramental)",
        "A sacrament is recognized by the church to be genuine and true when certain minimum requirements are met. These requirements concern proper form, matter, minister, and intent. The form means the words of prayer that are used in the sacramental rite, and the matter concerns the material or gesture constituting the outward and visible sign of a sacrament. The matter in baptism is water; bread and wine are the matter in the eucharist. The minister must be properly qualified and intend to do what the church intends in celebrating the sacrament. The minister at the eucharist is the celebrant, who must be a bishop or priest. The minimum form for a valid sacrament does not require the entire BCP liturgy. For example, an emergency baptism may be administered according to the form, &#8220;I baptize you in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit&#8221; (BCP, p. 313). In the situation of an emergency baptism, any baptized person can be a qualified minister of the sacrament. This minister would need to baptize with water, and intend to do what the church does in baptism. The concept of sacramental validity dates from the third century, when the Church of Rome held that schismatics and heretics could administer valid baptism. This contradicted the position of Cyprian, Bishop of Carthage, that the church&apos;s sacraments could not be administered by anyone outside the church. Augustine of Hippo subsequently insisted in his controversy with Donatism that the personal unworthiness of the minister does not impair the validity of sacraments celebrated by the minister (see Art. XXVI, Articles of Religion, BCP, p. 873). See Augustine of Hippo.",

        "Valle Crucis, North Carolina",
        "In 1842 Bishop Levi S. Ives of North Carolina decided to form a religious community in North Carolina on the model of the one that was beginning in Nashotah, Wisconsin. It was established in western North Carolina, near the Tennessee border, where three streams make their junction and thus form the shape of a cross. Valle Crucis (from the Latin &#8220;Valley of the Cross&#8221;) was also the name of a pre-Reformation monastery in the mountains of Wales. It was to be a place for an agricultural mission and a school for training clergy. The bishop intended it to be modeled after the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). He planned to serve as the general of the community. The first missionary there was the Rev. Henry H. Prout, who began his work late in 1842. In 1845 a training school for the ministry was opened, along with a classical and agricultural school for boys. The school opened with thirty boys and seven candidates for the ordained ministry. The first head of the school was the Rev. William Thurston. William West Skiles joined the community as a missionary and worked as a deacon in the area until 1862. Skiles practiced medicine among the mountain people and worked in the missions. The religious community which formed there was called the Order of the Holy Cross. The first members were professed in 1847 at St. Luke&apos;s Chapel, New York, while Bishop Ives attended the General Convention in New York. The first superior of the community was the Rev. William Glenny French. At first the Associate Mission and Training School for the Ministry was successful. Controversy plagued the community because of its monastic character. It disbanded in 1849. Valle Crucis closed when Bishop Ives resigned in 1852. Bishop Joseph Blount Chesire revived the school in the 1890s, but it closed in 1943. In the 1960s the property and facilities were converted into the Episcopal Church Conference Center. See Skiles, William West.",

Williams was educated at Charterhouse, The Royal College of Music, and Trinity College, Cambridge. He studied music with several of the most prominent musicians and composers of the day in England and Europe. His musical roots were the music of the Tudor period, Purcell, and most especially, English folk song. Williams was a prolific composer. His catalogue includes nine symphonies, as well as concertos, opera, ballet, music for films, songs, part songs, chamber music, and cantatas. Although never a professing Christian, he wrote several anthems, canticle settings and a Mass for two choirs. Williams left his greatest mark on church music as the editor of The English Hymnal (1906, revised 1933), Songs of Praise (1925, enlarged 1931), and The Oxford Book of Carols (1928). He was a proponent of unison singing by the congregation, and many of his own tunes and arrangements are for this medium. To hymnal repertoires he introduced British and Irish folk tunes and carols, Welsh hymn tunes, arrangements of historic German, French and Swiss tunes, tunes by Orlando Gibbons and Thomas Tallis, and English and Scottish Psalter tunes in their original forms. Most English language hymnals published since 1930 have been strongly influenced by his work as a hymnal editor, composer, and arranger. The Hymnal 1982 contains five of his original tunes, including Salve festa dies, used with &#8220;Hail thee, festival day!&#8221; (Hymns 175, 216, 225), The Call, used with &#8220;Come, my Way&#8221; (Hymn 487), and Down Ampney, used with &#8220;Come down, O Love divine&#8221; (Hymn 516), and seventeen of his arrangements.

The veil usually matches the vestments and altar hangings in the liturgical color of the season. It is draped over the pall, which is a white square placed on top of the paten, purificator, and chalice. The burse, which usually contains the corporal and purificators, is placed on top of the veil. After the ablutions following communion, the veil may once again be placed over the paten and chalice. The term has also indicated a linen covering that was placed over the unconsumed elements of the eucharist after communion. 2) Material used to cover the crosses in church after the stripping of the altar on Maundy Thursday. In some parishes, the processional cross, pictures, and statues are also veiled. Customs have varied for the veiling of crosses. Crosses have been veiled throughout Lent or during Passiontide, which was the last two weeks of Lent. This veiling has also been associated with Holy Week. Veils have been black, violet, or white. This veiling is not required in the Episcopal Church. 3) Veils are part of the religious habit worn by members of women&#039;s religious orders. The veil drapes over the top and back of the head to the shoulders, and possibly as far as the back, depending on the length of the veil. The veil of a professed sister may be black or another color. The veil worn by a novice is distinguishable from the veil worn by professed members of the community. A novice&#039;s veil may be white, and it may be shorter than the veil worn by professed sisters. In the early church, Christian women wore veils to indicate their religious vocation or status. Veils were worn by virgins who rejected marriage and by widows who would not marry again. See Humeral Veil; see Veil of the Temple.",

        "In the Jerusalem Temple, the veil or curtain of the temple was at the entrance to the most holy place (see Ex 26:33, 35:12, 39:34; 2 Chr 3:14). It has also been known as the holy of holies. This inner room contained the ark of the covenant, which was covered with the veil when the tabernacle was moved (Nm 4:5). At first only the Levitical priests could enter the most holy place (Nm 18:7). Eventually only the high priest could pass through the veil to enter the most holy place and only on the Day of Atonement (see Lv 16). The veil of the temple was torn when Jesus died on the cross (Mk 15:38). This has been associated with the removal of the barriers to right relationship between God and humanity through Jesus&apos; death. The Letter to the Hebrews notes that in Christ we have &#8220;a hope that enters the inner shrine behind the curtain, where Jesus, a forerunner on our behalf, has entered&#8221; (Heb 6:19-20; see Heb 10:19-20). This imagery of entering the most holy place through the veil is reflected in the hymn, &#8220;Humbly I adore thee, Verity unseen,&#8221; which states that faith &#8220;pierces through the veil&#8221; (Hymn 314).

        "A language that is commonly spoken in a locality, the native language of a place. In the early church, the vernacular was used as the language for Christian liturgy. However, language that was once vernacular may in time become archaic or disused as a common language of the people. For example, Latin became the vernacular in the areas of Roman imperial conquest in the west. As the vernacular language, Latin was also used as the language of liturgy. Other languages such as Italian, French, Spanish, and Portuguese eventually replaced Latin as the vernacular language in Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal. But Latin remained the language of liturgy in the Roman Catholic Church until the liturgical reforms of the Second Vatican Council (1963). At times there has been reluctance to change the language of liturgy, even when it has ceased to be vernacular. Some have associated an archaic or dead language with the mystery or transcendence of God. Others have found archaic or commonly disused language to hinder liturgical participation and understanding. Use of liturgical language that was often not understood by the laity tended to foster the clericalization of the liturgy. Vernacular language was used for worship by the churches of the Protestant Reformation. The 1549 BCP used sixteenth-century English. The Preface to the First Book of Common Prayer (1549) recalls that St. Paul urged the use of language in church that would be understandable and profitable for the people. However, &#8220;the Service in the Church of England (these many years) hath been read in Latin to the people, which they understood not; so that they have heard with their ears only; and their hearts, spirit, and mind, have not been edified thereby&#8221; (BCP, p. 866; See 1 Cor 14:9). The use of vernacular language was a distinguishing feature of the first Prayer Book.

It is mentioned by Tertullian and in the Apostolic Tradition of Hippolytus. During the fourth to sixth centuries the evening service came to take the form of vespers. Lauds and vespers, the two most important of the canonical day hours of prayer, were said at dawn and sunset. Vespers has also been called the &#8220;evening sacrifice&#8221; of prayer. Ps 141:2, &#8220;Let my prayer be set forth in your sight as incense, the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice,&#8221; has been traditionally associated with vespers.Archbishop Cranmer combined vespers with other offices for the BCP office of Evening Prayer. In addition to Evening Prayer, the 1979 BCP provides a form of evening service or vespers for use in the late afternoon or evening (p. 109).

The introduction of the surpliced choir in England has been associated with the Cambridge Camden Society. In the Episcopal Church, by 1865 there was a vested choir at Racine College in Racine, Wisconsin, under the leadership of James DeKoven. William Augustus Muhlenberg introduced the first vested boys&apos; choir in New York City at the Church of the Holy Communion. However, Bishop Charles P. McIlvaine of Ohio brought canonical proceedings against the Rev. Colin Tate of Columbus who vested his choir with surplices, and used processional and recessional hymns. In The Law of Ritualism (1866), Presiding Bishop John Henry Hopkins urged that a wide variety of ritual usage was permissible in the church. A vested choir of men and boys was present when Bishop Hopkins consecrated Bishops Henry Adams Neeley and Daniel Sylvester Tuttle in New York City in 1867. DeKoven defended the ritualist cause at the General Conventions of 1871 and 1874. He appealed for comprehensiveness and tolerance in worship. DeKoven&apos;s vision of a comprehensive approach to ritual eventually prevailed in the Episcopal Church. Although the use of choir vestments is not required, many Episcopal parishes have a vested choir. See DeKoven, James.",

These were open vestries in that all adult male parishioners could participate. It was like a modern annual congregational meeting. In Virginia the parishes were very large and it was difficult to get all the male parishioners together. So they would meet only once and elect twelve of their number to serve for life. This was known as a closed vestry. The transition to a closed vestry was completed by 1633 or 1634, when a Vestry Act was passed. It provided that &#8220;there be a vestrie held in each parish.&#8221; The current vestry evolved from this colonial pattern.The vestry is the legal representative of the parish with regard to all matters pertaining to its corporate property.

        "Vincentian Canon",
        "The canonical threefold test of catholicity is found in the fifth-century Commonitorium of Vincent of Lérins (d. c. 445). Vincent was a monk on the island of Lérins in Gaul. He may have written the Commonitorium around 434. It defines the catholic faith as &#8220;what has been believed everywhere, always, and by all.&#8221; It was often misquoted by nineteenth-century English writers who put &#8220;antiquity&#8221; first. It is often used by Anglican scholars as a patristic source for Hooker&apos;s &#8220;three legged stool&#8221; of scripture, tradition, and reason as sources of authority in Anglicanism. The Commonitorium, written by Vincent under the pseudonym &#8220;Peregrinus,&#8221; is a guide to the catholic faith and the source of the Vincentian Canon. The Commonitorium emphasizes the primacy of scripture as the ground of truth. It also places significant emphasis on tradition and allows for development of doctrine as scripture is more fully explicated.",

        "Virgin Birth",
        "This term describes the birth of Jesus. Jesus&apos; mother was Mary, and he was conceived through the power of the Holy Spirit, without a human father. Mary&apos;s virginity at the time of Jesus&apos; birth is mentioned specifically in the gospels of Matthew (Ch. 1) and Luke (Ch. 1). Although Matthew and Luke have two very different stories about the origin of Jesus, they both clearly state that he was born of a virgin. The prologue to the Gospel of John has a statement that could be interpreted as a virgin birth (Jn 1:12-13), but the term is not used. The Virgin Birth is a way of describing Jesus as the Son of God. It is a way of verifying Jesus&apos; true humanity and divinity. Although Jesus is a human being, he is believed to be truly distinct from all other human beings. There is some indication in Christian writings that the term &#8220;Virgin Birth&#8221; can be understood as a way of helping to understand Jesus&apos; humanity and divinity. Belief in the Virgin Birth was not completely accepted by all early Christians. Some Christians today question it as a historical fact. The Virgin Birth is affirmed by the Nicene Creed and the Apostles&apos; Creed. The Catechism states that &#8220;by God&apos;s own act his divine Son received our human nature from the Virgin Mary, his mother&#8221; (BCP, p. 849). Belief in the Virgin Birth does not imply belief in the Roman Catholic doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, which holds that Mary was free of all sin, including original sin, from her conception.

Water is characterized by fluidity, formlessness, and an almost endless ability to adapt itself to shapes and temperatures. Genesis describes the formless waste at the beginning of creation as &#8220;the waters&#8221; (Gn 1:2). Everything is born out of the primeval waters of chaos. The earth itself takes form when it emerges from the waters.The principal use of water in Christian worship is to immerse the candidate in baptism. It is a sign not only of cleansing but of ritual death and rebirth in Jesus Christ. Water is the sacramental matter of baptism. The use of &#8220;holy water&#8221; for blessing, or for signing oneself with the cross, is intended to renew baptism and the baptismal covenant in the believer. Water is also mixed with wine in the chalice at the eucharist, recalling the general custom in the ancient world of mixing water with wine before drinking it. It was given a symbolic interpretation during the Monophysite controversy. The mixture of water and wine was seen as symbolic of the union of humanity and deity in the person of Christ. The monophysites refused to add water, symbolizing their belief in one nature of the Incarnate Word. See Matter (Sacramental).  ",

        "Watts, Isaac",
        "(July 17, 1674-Nov. 25, 1748). Nonconformist clergyman. He was born in Southampton, England. He served from 1699 to 1702 as assistant and from 1702 until 1712 as pastor of an independent church in Mark Lane, London. Watts was never robust, and he went into semi-retirement in 1712 at the home of Sir Thomas Abney, where he lived until his death. There he devoted himself to writing theological and philosophical works, as well as hymns and metrical psalms. He is often considered &#8220;the father of English hymnody.&#8221; His Hymns and Spiritual Songs was published in 1707 and his metrical psalter in 1719. His metrical psalms are not strict paraphrases but Christianized versions of the psalms, as the title of his collection indicates, The Psalms of David, Imitated in the Language of the New Testament (London, 1719). Seventeen of his hymns or metrical psalms are used in The Hymnal 1982, including &#8220;Joy to the world! the Lord is come&#8221; (Hymn 100), &#8220;Come, let us join our cheerful songs with angels round the throne&#8221; (Hymn 374), &#8220;When I survey the wondrous cross&#8221; (Hymn 474), &#8220;Jesus shall reign where&apos;er the sun&#8221; (Hymn 544), and &#8220;O God, our help in ages past&#8221; (Hymn 680).",

He was born in Millington, Maryland, and baptized Lewis Thomas Wattson. He received his B.A. (1882) and his M.A. (1885) from St. Stephen&apos;s (Bard) College and his B.D. from the General Theological Seminary in 1887. He was ordained deacon on June 5, 1885, and priest on Dec. 12, 1886. He began his ordained ministry in Port Deposit, Maryland, and then became rector of St. John&apos;s Church, Kingston, New York. In 1894 he began publishing The Pulpit of the Cross, an Anglo-catholic parish bulletin. In 1895 he became the superior of an Episcopal mission in Omaha. In Dec. 1898 he and Lurana Mary White founded the Society of the Atonement, an order which was to work for the unity of the church. On July 27, 1900, he made his monastic profession before Bishop Leighton Coleman of Delaware and took the name Paul James Francis. In 1903 he began publishing The Lamp, which stressed the reunion of the Anglican Communion and the Church of Rome. Wattson founded the Church Unity Octave in 1909, an eight-day period of prayer for Christian unity. He began to doubt the validity of Anglican orders, and on Oct. 30, 1909, he, Mother Lurana, and fifteen others were received into the Roman Catholic Church. Wattson was ordained a Roman Catholic priest on July 16, 1910. He died in Garrison, New York. See Society of the Atonement; see Week of Prayer for Christian Unity; see White, Lurana Mary.",

        "Way of the Cross (Stations of the Cross)",
        "A devotion to the Passion of Christ which recalls a series of events at the end of Jesus&apos; life from his condemnation to his burial. The Way of the Cross imitates the practice of visiting the places of Jesus&apos; Passion in the Holy Land by early Christian pilgrims. The first stations outside Palestine were built in Bologna in the fifth century. This devotion was encouraged by the Franciscans, and it became common in the fifteenth century. The number of stations for prayer and meditation in the Way of the Cross has varied, but it typically includes fourteen stations. Each station may have a cross and an artistic representation of the scene. The stations may be erected inside a church or outdoors. The BOS includes the following stations in the Way of the Cross: 1) Jesus is condemned to death; 2) Jesus takes up his cross; 3) Jesus falls the first time; 4) Jesus meets his afflicted mother; 5) the cross is laid on Simon of Cyrene; 6) a woman wipes the face of Jesus; 7) Jesus falls a second time; 8) Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem; 9) Jesus falls a third time; 10) Jesus is stripped of his garments; 11) Jesus is nailed to the cross; 12) Jesus dies on the cross; 13) the body of Jesus is placed in the arms of his mother; 14) Jesus is laid in the tomb. The BOS notes that eight of the stations are based on events that are recorded in the gospels. The remaining six (stations 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 13) are based on inferences from the gospels or pious legends. The BOS allows these six stations to be omitted from the Way of the Cross. The BOS provides opening devotions and the Lord&apos;s Prayer. There is a versicle and response, a reading, a prayer, and a collect for each of the fourteen stations. Concluding prayers before the altar follow the fourteenth station in the BOS service. The hymn Stabat Mater has been associated with the Way of the Cross. Verses of this hymn traditionally have been sung between each of the stations when the devotion is done by a congregation. The Stabat Mater appears as &#8220;At the cross her vigil keeping,&#8221; Hymn 159 in The Hymnal 1982. The BOS suggests that verses of this hymn be sung as the ministers enter for the Way of the Cross and as they approach the first station. The BOS also suggests that the Trisagion be chanted as the procession goes from station to station. The Way of the Cross is a popular devotion that is often done on Fridays during Lent. However, it should not displace the Proper Liturgy for Good Friday. Some have questioned its disassociation of Jesus&apos; death from his resurrection.",

        "Founded in 1941 by Bishop Henry Wise Hobson of Southern Ohio, this program provided a &#8220;church on wheels&#8221; to minister in areas with no Episcopal parish. Its inspiration was a portable office used by Standard Oil. The name &#8220;Wayside Cathedral&#8221; was suggested by the decision to demolish and not replace the badly dilapidated St. Paul&apos;s Cathedral in Cincinnati. Sale of the cathedral property helped to support the new venture. Hobson went to Detroit and had a trailer built which he pulled behind his automobile. Bishop Hobson himself often accompanied the &#8220;Wayside Cathedral.&#8221; This program emphasized evangelism and spiritual growth, reflecting two particular emphases in his diocese. A correspondence Sunday School was started in connection with the &#8220;Wayside Cathedral.&#8221; At one time, more than one thousand children were reached by this ministry.",

Keyed to this hymnal is another volume by the Roths, entitled Rudiments of Music Worksheets, which has worksheets for children. All the volumes were published by Church Hymnal Corporation in 1989. A cassette recording of twenty-eight of these selections is also available. It is a recording by a choir of boys and girls from St. Paul&apos;s Church, Akron, Ohio.

The first (1722) reproduced that of the 1637 Scottish BCP. Its eucharistic prayer contained elements from the eucharistic prayer of the 1549 BCP that were missing in later English Prayer Books. Significant changes were made in later printings. In 1735 a prayer of oblation, &#8220;which we now offer unto thee,&#8221; was inserted. Bishop Thomas Rattray&apos;s reconstruction The Ancient Liturgy of the Church of Jerusalem (1744) led to the invocation of the Holy Spirit upon the elements being moved to a West Syrian position-following the anamnesis rather than preceding the institution narrative-in a 1755 printing. In the 1764 &#8220;Wee Bookie&#8221; the epiclesis was abbreviated and reworded, &#8220;that they may become the body and blood of thy most dearly beloved Son,&#8221; and the eucharistic prayer was linked to the Sanctus by the insertion of &#8220;All glory be to thee.&#8221; The first American Prayer Book picked up this phrase. Its prayer, however, was based on the 1755 &#8220;Wee Bookie&#8221; with its fuller form of epiclesis, except that &#8220;may be to us the body and blood of thy most dearly beloved Son&#8221; was omitted.",

        "Week of Prayer for Christian Unity",
        "This observance began on St. Peter&apos;s Day, June 29, 1900, when Spencer Jones, a Church of England priest, preached a sermon on closer relations with the Church of Rome. Jones urged that sermons be preached on St. Peter&apos;s Day emphasizing Rome as the center of unity. Paul James Wattson, an Episcopal priest, suggested that the Octave from the Feast of St. Peter&apos;s Chair (Jan. 18) to the Feast of the Conversion of St. Paul (Jan. 25) be a time of prayer for Christian unity on a papal basis. Church Unity Week was first observed in 1908, and later the name was changed to the Church Unity Octave by Wattson. In the 1930s, it was suggested by Abbé Paul Couturier, a Roman Catholic priest in France, that the basis for prayer be broadened to include all who desired unity in Jesus Christ, without reference to the Pope. Also in the 1930s, Wattson changed the name to the Chair of Unity Octave. Since 1966 the Faith and Order Commission of the World Council of Churches and the Vatican Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity have worked together on common international texts for the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity.

Weems was ordained deacon on Sept. 5, 1784, and priest on Sept. 12, 1784. This was made possible when Parliament passed the Enabling Act on Aug. 13, 1784, which enabled English bishops to ordain clergy for the American Church without requiring the loyalty oath to the English sovereign. He was rector of All Hallows&apos; Parish, Anne Arundel County, 1784-1789, and of Westminster Parish in the same county, 1790-1792. For about two decades Weems preached at different Virginia parishes, notably at Pohick Church, where George Washington worshiped before the Revolution. This enabled him later to refer to himself as &#8220;Formerly rector of Mt. Vernon Parish.&#8221; Weems was a book peddler and writer from 1791 until his death.

It was succeeded and continued by the Standard of the Cross. Witness, The. Monthly journal published by the Episcopal Church Publishing Company. It was founded in 1917 as an organization financially independent from the Episcopal Church. The first issue appeared on Jan. 6, 1917. At first it was edited by Bishop Irving Peake Johnson (1866-1947) of Colorado. It was a weekly publication until June 10, 1937. Johnson envisioned a publication that was accessible to the working class. In the earlier years, The Witness combined traditional church news and advertising with impassioned editorials concerning workers&apos; rights and other issues of religious and social consequence. Under the Rev. William Benjamin Spofford (1892-1972), who succeeded Johnson as editor, the periodical became embroiled in the Industrial Democracy movement. The activist nature of The Witness was thus established. Although it has undergone changes in frequency of publication and appearance, it retains its emphasis on social action and justice in light of the gospel. Its roots remain Episcopal, but its readership is ecumenical.",

        "A woman who has remained unmarried since the death of her husband. In biblical times, women were very much dependent on male relatives for their welfare. A woman could find herself in a vulnerable and defenseless position when her husband died. An untimely and early death of the husband could be seen as judgment for sin, which could also mean disgrace for the widow (see Is 54:4). After the death of her husband and sons, Ruth lamented that God had dealt harshly with her and brought calamity on her (Ru 1:20-21). The OT calls for the care and protection of widows (see Dt 10:18, 14:28-29, 24:19, 26:12). The plight of widows was at times associated with orphans. The Lord upholds the orphan and widow (Ps 146:9), and they are not to be abused (Ex 22:22). In the NT, Jesus warns that those who devour widows&apos; houses and say long prayers for the sake of appearance will receive the greater condemnation (Lk 20:47). The Letter of James (1:27) describes pure and undefiled religion in terms of caring for orphans and widows in their distress. Seven members of the Christian community were appointed to the task of waiting on tables after the Hellenists complained that their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution of food (Acts 6:1-7). A widow&apos;s family should contribute to her support (1 Tm 5:4, 16). There was a distinct order or society of &#8220;real widows&#8221; in the early church (see 1 Tm 5:3-16). Real widows set their hope on God, and continued night and day in supplications and prayers. In order to be placed on the church&apos;s list, a widow had to be sixty years old, married only once, and well attested for good works, such as bringing up children, showing hospitality, washing the saints&apos; feet, and helping the afflicted. Concern that younger widows would want to marry again led to advice that they should not be put on the list of widows (1 Tm 5:11). Enrolled widows constituted a charitable organization or ministry for the church. Their duties included nursing the sick, giving alms, and evangelizing pagan women. The order of widows had declined by the fourth century, and their work was done by deaconesses. In the church, widowhood came to be associated with honor and service rather than shame.

Wilberforce studied at St. John&apos;s College, Cambridge University, 1776-1779. In 1780 he was elected to the House of Commons representing Hull. It was in the House of Commons that he worked against slavery and the slave trade. Wilberforce became active in the abolition effort as early as 1787 through his association with the Quaker-founded Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade. His first political success occurred on May 9, 1788, when legislation was passed that reduced the number of slaves carried aboard a slave vessel. Because of overcrowding, the mortality rate in slave vessels was quite high. Under Wilberforce&apos;s leadership, Parliament passed the bill for the abolition of the slave trade in 1807. From then until his death, Wilberforce worked for the abolition of slavery in the British Empire. On Aug. 28, 1833, a month after his death, the bill of Parliament abolishing slavery throughout the British dominions received the King&apos;s consent and became law. In 1797 Wilberforce published his major reform volume, A Practical View of the Prevailing Religious System of Professed Christians in the Higher and Middle Classes in the Country, Contrasted with Real Christianity. The chief point of the book was to distinguish between two types of Christians, the nominal or lukewarm and the real or vital. The vital Christian knows that conversion and the transformation of life are at the heart of Christianity. Wilberforce died in London. His life and work are commemorated in the Episcopal calendar of the church year on July 30.",

        "Wine",
        "Alcoholic beverage made from the fermented juice of grapes. Wine and bread are the essential elements of the eucharist. Wine is associated with celebration, fellowship, and joy. In Judaism, bread and wine were used in household worship such as the Sabbath meal and the Passover meal. The synoptic gospels identify Jesus&#8217; Last Supper with his disciples on the night before his death as a Passover meal. At this meal Jesus identified the cup of wine with his blood of the new covenant and foretold that he would not again drink &#8220;the fruit of the vine&#8221; with his disciples until drinking it new with them in the kingdom of God (Mt 26:26-29, Mk 14:22-25, Lk 22:14-20). This identification of Christ&#8217;s blood of the new covenant with the wine is continued in the institution narratives of the eucharistic prayers of the BCP (pp. 342, 363, 368, 371, 374). Rite 1, Prayer I identifies the wine with Christ&#8217;s blood of the New Testament (BCP, p. 335). However, the doctrine of concomitance upholds the truth of sacramental theology that Christ&#8217;s body and blood are both present in each of the eucharistic elements of bread and wine. Christ is understood to be &#8220;really present&#8221; in a special way in the consecrated elements of bread and wine. The bread and wine constitute the sacramental matter of the eucharist.It is customary to add a little water to the wine in preparing the altar for the eucharistic prayer. This custom is known as the &#8220;mixed chalice.&#8221; Wine of any color may be used at the eucharist. There is to be only one chalice on the altar during the prayer of consecration. Additional chalices may be filled from a flagon containing consecrated wine after the eucharistic prayer is completed. If there is insufficient wine to distribute to the people, additional wine may be consecrated by the celebrant. Any consecrated wine that is not administered at communion may be consumed by the ministers, reserved, or disposed of in a reverent manner. Some Protestant churches substitute grape juice for wine and substitute individual small cups for the common chalice or cup at their celebrations of communion.

Among the books of the Apocrypha, Ecclesiasticus (The Wisdom of Jesus the son of Sirach) and the Wisdom of Solomon also belong to this wisdom category. In contrast to other parts of the OT, such as the Pentateuch and the former and latter prophets, which stress God&apos;s initiative in revealing the divine nature and will for his people, Israel&apos;s earliest wisdom literature stressed the human search for order in society and nature. In Israel the main roots of the wisdom movement were 1) the family and clan, as suggested by many of the Proverbs where the parent admonishes the child; and 2) the royal court in Jerusalem where Solomon reigned and is said to have been a source of wisdom (1 Kgs 4:29-34). It was presumably for this reason that the authorship of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes are attributed to him. The wisdom movement continued through the intertestamental period when God was clearly identified as the author of order, termed wisdom. According to Ecclesiasticus (1:4), wisdom (a feminine noun) was God&apos;s first creation. Eventually wisdom was personified, attributed a heavenly status and even viewed as God&apos;s first-born. St. Paul identifies Christ with the wisdom of God (1 Cor 1:24).",

        "Word of God, The",
        "This phrase can indicate the effective and creative verbal expression of God&apos;s power; or the Holy Scriptures that were written under God&apos;s inspiration; or Jesus Christ, the Logos, the eternal Son of God, the Word made flesh (Jn 1:1-14). The power of God&apos;s creative word is shown in Genesis (1:3) when God said &#8220;&apos;let there be light&apos;; and there was light.&#8221; The heavens and all the heavenly hosts were made by the word of God (Ps 33:6). God&apos;s word is also communicated in the OT through the law and the prophets. The decalogue is literally the ten words of God, and the law is identified with the word of God in the OT (see Dt 4:13, 5:6-21; Ex 20:2-17, 34:28). The prophets proclaimed the word of God with power, making known God&apos;s righteous will. The word of God was like fire (Jer 20:9, 23:29), and effective (Is 55:11). As stated in Hebrews (4:12), &#8220;the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing until it divides soul from spirit, joints from marrow; it is able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.&#8221; As the word of God conveyed revelation, the term also was applied to the gospel of Jesus (see Lk 5:1, 8:1, 11:28, Jn 3:34) and the gospel as preached by the apostles (see Acts 4:31; 13:44, 48; 16:32). The scriptures were inspired by God (see 2 Tm 3:16, 2 Pt 1:21), and are termed the word of God. The Catechism notes that we call the scriptures the Word of God &#8220;because God inspired their human authors and because God still speaks to us through the Bible&#8221; (BCP, p. 853). After the lessons at Morning and Evening Prayer and at the eucharist, the reader may say, &#8220;The Word of the Lord&#8221; (see BCP, pp. 84, 119, 357). A literalistic view holds that the Bible contains God&apos;s actual words which were dictated to inspired scribes who put the words on paper. Few Anglicans would endorse this literalistic view. Others have suggested that the authors or editors of biblical material communicated their faith in their own words after being inspired by God. The ultimate expression of God&apos;s word was not in law, prophecy, or scripture, but in Jesus Christ, the incarnate Word of God. See Scripture; see Logos.",

In a Rite 1 Eucharist, the ministers also may use the historic words of administration derived from the 1559 Prayer Book, which identified the sacrament as the body and blood of Christ and urged the communicant to receive the sacrament &#8220;in remembrance&#8221; of Christ&apos;s sacrifice (BCP, p. 338).",

He was educated at Winchester School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he served as a fellow from 1830 to 1836. Wordsworth was headmaster at Harrow School, 1836-1844. He was canon of Westminster, 1844-1869, and was also vicar of Stanford-in-the-Vale-cum-Goosey, Berkshire. Wordsworth was the Hulsean lecturer at Cambridge from 1848 until 1849. He was rural dean from 1850-1869, and Archdeacon of Westminster, 1865-1869. He was Bishop of Lincoln, 1869-1885. He was a celebrated Greek scholar and published in several fields. Wordsworth frequently visited and corresponded with William Wordsworth, and began hymn writing after the poet&apos;s death in 1850. He continued to write hymns until he became Bishop of Lincoln in 1869. Wordsworth believed hymns to be &#8220;one of the most efficacious instruments for correcting error and for disseminating truth, as well as for ministering comfort and edification.&#8221; His The Holy Year; or Hymns for Sundays and Holy Days throughout the Year, came out in 1862. The Hymnal 1982 uses eight of his hymns, including &#8220;O day of radiant gladness&#8221; (Hymn 48), &#8220;Songs of thankfulness and praise&#8221; (Hymn 135, stanzas 1-3), and &#8220;See the conqueror mounts in triumph&#8221; (Hymn 215).

It is both a verb and a noun, used to translate the Latin verb adorare and the noun cultus and their equivalents in other languages. It was defined by Evelyn Underhill as &#8220;the response of the creature to the Eternal.&#8221; It is a very broad term concerning acts of adoration, which may be as diverse as private prayer and meditation, public corporate liturgies, prayer services, or cultic sacrifices.

He entered Oxford University around 1345 and received his doctorate in theology around 1372. Wycliffe was appointed rector of Fillingham, Lincolnshire, in 1361, warden of Canterbury Hall in 1365, rector of Ludgershall in 1368, and finally rector of Lutterworth in 1374, where he remained until his death. He was a critic of the worldly papacy of the fourteenth century and an opponent of monasticism. He argued that monasticism placed one class of Christians above another, and he called for the dissolution of all the monasteries. His primary criticism was of the doctrine of transubstantiation. He insisted that the bread and wine remain bread and wine after the consecration. He taught that the church is not centered in the Pope and the Cardinals but that the church is the whole company of the elect and its only head is Christ. Wycliffe claimed that the Bible is the only standard for Christian faith and practice and that it should be read in English. He and others translated the Bible from the Vulgate into English. This was his major achievement as a reformer. His published treatises included De Dominio Divino (1375), De Civili Dominio (1376), De Ecclesia (1378), and De Potestate Papae (1379). On May 22, 1377, Pope Gregory XI issued five bulls condemning the work of Wycliffe. He died in Lutterworth. The Council of Constance in 1415 condemned 267 errors in his teaching, ordered that his books be burned and that his bones be dug up and burned. Wycliffe&apos;s followers were called Lollards. He has been called the &#8220;Morning Star of the Reformation.&#8221;",
