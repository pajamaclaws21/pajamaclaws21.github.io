        <h1>cults</h1><p>
        something that's <a href="/weblog/surveillance-state.html">scary</a>. <br>

        You should know that "cult" is obviously loaded language. Carries associations with murder and things, with mass suicides; hell, even the dictionary definition says they're "regarded by others as strange or sinister or as imposing excessive control over members." thanks, oxford languages. <br><br>

        zizians, merveilles, bell labs. <br>
        where is the inherent difference between these three? <br>
        the zizians are a rationalist group that have been linked to murder!! obviously! big difference from merveilles & one hundred rabbits and then bell labs, which are maybe better characterized as similarly-philosophically-oriented <a href="/weblog/hacker.html">hacker groups</a>. i have yet to read enough cat-v about bell labs to pretend to be an expert but there really do seem to be some similarities. <br><br>

        god i mean actually the <a href="https://merveilles.town/about">merveilles town page</a> has some shit about not allowing pictures of animal products. i really do hope the rationalists haven't gotten to them. <br><br>

        the zizians are a natural response to <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/">rationalism</a>---something like that was always going to happen. i will make no attempt to hide that I Do Not Know Everything about rationalism; <br><br>

        i think rationalism is sacreligious and maybe that's stupid; you are never going to be truly rational, there is no Truly Rational. check baudrillard's shit about human value systems.
