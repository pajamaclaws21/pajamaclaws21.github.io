        Maintain esoteric language and postmodernism!! Although we have transcended non-meaning with the advent of 67, we should keep the esoteric language. Creating gnosis is the method by which we maintain ourselves against generative AI: lock them all out. Slopping together <a href="/experiments/maze.html">mazes and labyrinths</a> made of nothing in order to hide the meanings of somethings. Ponerlos in Disneyland. Esotericize by <a href="/weblog/semantic.html">increasing the semantic density</a> of the English language. By Greek and Latinifying. By crossing language barriers. Spanish is a colonizer language, too; <em>no sabo</em> is anti-indigenous; why not combine all of our languages and see how far we get? Of course we must understand the Bible in its original form and not through translation. Translation, as Anne Carson says, is trying to cross a chasm. But it is an art that I have a deep, deep passion for. Is the art of translation inherently personal/violent/sexual? I don't know, there's something there about how you twist the meanings of the words, pressing your fingers into the semantic meat---I think that the all-languages are sort of silly concepts, the eso-con-langs and psuedocodes and all that try to make something universal. Maybe the tower of Babel really was the right way to go? I don't know. I really don't know anything at all.
