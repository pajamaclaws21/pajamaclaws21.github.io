        10 years on the internet! 10 years coding! Something philosophical to be said. Maybe I'll come back and add some more. All I can say is it's been a great time and I'm so ready to be back for 10 more. I've already started adding 90 million new pages to my website and so I think that's the perfect celebration. Maximalism, I mean, even if nonmaintainable. There are so many hidden pages on this website that I don't think I could ever find them all... thank you Github Pages. Maybe when that's gone, when this deployment turn has ended, these tiny little things will all go away too. The website has been redone so many times --- I don't even remember what it looked like all the way in the beginning, before the ICD-10 inspired look. I think it was more minimalist. I like this silly returning thing. The times new roman internet font. Enjoy your diving into my rabbit hole
