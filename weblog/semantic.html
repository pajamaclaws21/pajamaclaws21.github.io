a: have you checked out xxiivv yet? The link is on the cool page. They have this whole <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/arvelie.html">time system</a> that I think is very cool, but I also unfortunately sort of also <a href="/weblog/cult.html">kind of think everyone is a member of a cult</a> and so am a titch scared of them. the goal of this thing is to try and differentiate the words i'm talking about. Let's see if I can stick to it? I dunno, that's my main thing; I want to be able to come out with something that I can actually use. And I'm pretty bad at that.
