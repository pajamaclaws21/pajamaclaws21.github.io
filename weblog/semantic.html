        coming soon: <br>
        increased semantic density <br>
        that will be used on this website <br>
        like merveilles, or 100rb---<a href="/poetry/craigslist.html?poem=impossible">even for a day</a>

        <br><br><br><br>
        <b>q: like merveilles <em>how?</em></b><br>
        a: have you checked out xxiivv yet? The link is on the cool page. They have this whole <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/arvelie.html">time system</a> that I think is very cool, but I also unfortunately sort of also <a href="/weblog/cult.html">kind of think everyone is a member of a cult</a> and so am a titch scared of them. the goal of this thing is to try and differentiate the words i'm talking about. Let's see if I can stick to it? I dunno, that's my main thing; I want to be able to come out with something that I can actually use. And I'm pretty bad at that. IT IS A SHAME!! Their language page is so so so amazing! Their thoughts are so amazing! Why are they scary? It feels like an endpoint
        <br><br>
        main thought: is there a single affix that denotes the class of a word? To make it a noun or an adverb. I dunno that's the main thing I want: semanticity is not a common word, but I put it on a commit message for this. Thalassophobically. Something.
