cults

You should know that "cult" is obviously loaded language. Carries associations with murder and things, with mass suicides; hell, even the dictionary definition says they're "regarded by others as strange or sinister or as imposing excessive control over members." thanks, oxford languages.

zizians, merveilles, bell labs.
where is the inherent difference between these three?
the zizians are a rationalist group that have been linked to murder!! obviously! big difference from merveilles & one hundred rabbits and then bell labs, which are maybe better characterized as similarly-philosophically-oriented hacker groups. i have yet to read enough cat-v about bell labs to pretend to be an expert but there really do seem to be some similarities.

god i mean actually the <a href="https://merveilles.town/about">merveilles town page</a> has some shit about not allowing pictures of animal products. i really do hope the rationalists haven't gotten to them.

the zizians are a natural response to <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/">rationalism</a>---something like that was always going to happen. i will make no attempt to hide that I Do Not Know Everything about rationalism;

i think rationalism is sacreligious and maybe that's stupid; you are never going to be truly rational, there is no Truly Rational. check baudrillard's shit about human value systems.
