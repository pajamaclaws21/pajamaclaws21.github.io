Saw a friend's post that they are going to be limiting their activity on social media because they have to leave the country. Also saw a news source the other day about how so many companies are divesting from <a href="https://withpersona.com/">Persona</a> and <a href="https://www.flocksafety.com/">Flock</a>, recently. And of course, all of my US folks should know about how the govt. is currently checking folks' social media when they re-enter the country.
